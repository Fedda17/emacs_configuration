<p>While cephalopods have captured the imagination of marine biologists, science fiction writers, and curious individuals, itâ€™s only recently that the public has become significantly interested in learning more about these animals. Part of their appeal has come from recent studies revealing the intelligence behind some of their sophisticated behaviors.</p>
