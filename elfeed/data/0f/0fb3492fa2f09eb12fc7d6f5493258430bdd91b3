Perhaps it takes a terminal case of Economist Brain to look at a land in the grip of endless war and say &#8220;You know what this place needs? Some GDP!&#8221;. But I think it&#8217;s an important exercise, because economic development provides a nation with a purpose other than <a href="https://criticallegalthinking.com/2016/01/20/fanon-on-violence-and-the-person/">the catharsis of violence</a>. And having that long-term vision fixed in place helps to make decisions about leadership in the present, too, because it allows people to ask &#8220;Which leaders will get us closer to that bright, prosperous future?&#8221;. </p><p>Nor is it unrealistic to think that in half a century&#8217;s time, Gaza might be an economically flourishing place.

They escaped those bad times, and perhaps Gaza can too. </p><p>Of course, that sort of development requires national self-determination, an end to major external conflicts, and long-term political stability. I&#8217;m not sure anyone knows how to get those things for Gaza right now. But I think it&#8217;s important to have a picture in mind of what the benefits might look like. </p><p>So here&#8217;s a quick sketch of a vision for the economic future of Gaza. It starts with a quantitative goal: raising per capita GDP to $10,000 in PPP terms. I then speculate on a few industries that Gaza could target, using some other countries as comparisons. And I talk a bit about how migration could play a significant role. I don&#8217;t mean to present this vision as an exclusive one  &#8212; there are plenty of alternative approaches and goals, and this is far from a detailed road map in any case. But I hope this post will be enough to jump-start some thinking about better days.</p><h4>A concrete goal: Raise Gazan per capita GDP (PPP) to $10,000 </h4><p>A lot of people, especially on the left of the political spectrum, criticize GDP&#8217;s usefulness as a measure of human welfare. And sure, there are plenty of important things GDP leaves out (leisure, inequality, political freedom, life expectancy, education, and so on). But GDP is <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/augmented-hdi-vs-gdp-per-capita">strongly correlated</a> with broader measures of well-being like the Human Development Index, and with <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/median-daily-per-capita-expenditure-vs-gdp-per-capita">median levels of consumption</a>. If you increase GDP, your country is highly likely to be healthier, longer-lived, better-fed, better-educated, happier, and so on. </p>
