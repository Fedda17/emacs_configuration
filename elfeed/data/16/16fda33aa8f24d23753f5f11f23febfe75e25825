<p>When TIME<a href="https://time.com/person-of-the-year-2021-elon-musk/"> named Elon Musk as its 2021 Person of the Year</a>, it referred to him as someone who &#8220;aspires to save our planet... [a] clown, genius, edgelord, visionary, industrialist, showman, cad; a madcap hybrid of Thomas Edison, P.T. Barnum, Andrew Carnegie and Watchmen&#8217;s Doctor Manhattan.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Musk had, to TIME, &#8220;defied the haters,&#8221; and it described him as someone who &#8220;a few short years ago&#8221; was dismissed as a &#8220;crazy con artist on the verge of going broke,&#8221; referring to a man who as far back as 2016 was<a href="https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mkk45mmfk/4-elon-musk/?sh=5eee5e4359eb"> named one of the richest people in the world by Forbes</a>. TIME said that Musk was &#8220;easily cast as a hubristic supervillain&#8221; just like other &#8220;tech bros and space playboys,&#8221; but he is somehow &#8220;different&#8221; because he&#8217;s &#8220;a manufacturing magnate&#8221; that &#8220;moves metal, not bytes.&#8221;</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wheresyoured.at/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Ed Zitron's Where's Your Ed At!

Jeff Bezos<a href="https://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace-tech/a-clock-for-the-next-civilization-what-could-it-say-about-the-past-and-future/"> invested $42 million into the Long Now Foundation</a>, most of which has gone into the creation of The Millenium Clock, a 10,000-year clock that exists to &#8220;encourage imagination at the timescale of civilization,&#8221; rather than what a regular person spends money on &#8212; food, shelter, utilities, and so on.</p><p>These comparisons are, of course, trite, but they&#8217;re important to make when considering the ramifications of leaving our future in their hands. Elon Musk does not wake up worrying about his mortgage, or bills, or whether he will make it to work on time, or if he will be yelled at for his performance on the job. These men are not simply elevated above society, but mentally abstracted from the human experience of challenges and concerns that an actual person will face.</p><p>As a result, trusting them to be reliable stewards of the tools they create or acquire is inherently dangerous, because what is good for <em>them</em> will always trump what is good for everybody else.

In 2021, Australia passed t<a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/by-industry/digital-platforms-and-services/news-media-bargaining-code/news-media-bargaining-code">he News Media Bargaining Code (NMBC)</a>, which forced digital platforms (particularly those in search and social) to come to a revenue-sharing agreement with media outlets. If the two sides couldn&#8217;t reach an amicable agreement, an arbiter would step in and make a binding ruling.</p><p>To be clear, Facebook initially blocked news links from Australian Facebook feeds, but<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-56165015"> eventually caved after a few short days</a>. As the Canadian law is similar in scope to the NMBC, the likelihood that the two companies would have reached a compromise &#8212; either with publishers or the government &#8212; was high. Shutting off news access at a time of natural disaster was nothing short of petulant, selfish avarice.

Twitter (I will <em>never</em> call it &#8220;X&#8221;) became a hub of disinformation and chaos over the weekend as the unverified hellscape combined useful emergency preparedness for Hurricane Hillary with disinformation and conspiracy theories. While this was a problem that existed before Musk&#8217;s takeover (<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2022/10/05/fact-check-baseless-hurricane-ian-conspiracy-theory-spreads-online/8168529001/">and existed on other networks</a>), Twitter&#8217;s current lack of a real trust and safety team means that<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/maui-wildfire-social-media-conspiracy-theories-rcna100034"> insane conspiracy theories about the devastating Maui Wildfires have had millions of impressions</a>, with<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattnovak/2023/08/11/conspiracy-theorists-go-viral-with-claim-space-lasers-are-to-blame-for-hawaii-fires/?sh=15c298374529"> many of them featuring a &#8220;verified&#8221; checkmark that could confuse a reasonable person into believing they are real</a>.</p><p>This, to Elon Musk, is what something &#8220;great for humanity&#8221; looks like &#8212; a murky soup of real and questionable information that indirectly or otherwise makes the world a stupider and nastier place to be. He does not see the harm of diluting Twitter&#8217;s information (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/20/23838823/twitter-x-deleted-pictures-links-2014-metadata-t-co-shortener">or breaking every image and link before 2014</a>) because it really, truly doesn&#8217;t matter &#8212; he has aides that will provide him information, people that exist to learn things for him, accountants to manage his funds, and<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-05-06/who-is-jared-birchall-meet-elon-musk-s-fixer-and-right-hand-man"> handlers like former banking executive Jared Birchall</a> to make sure that the things that could hurt him are isolated and, if possible, eradicated. When you are rich, powerful and insulated, you do not perceive problems, and thus you do not think they exist. They want the ability to write and amend the social contract in perpetuity.</p><p>And none of them are more flagrant than Musk, as Ronan Farrow<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/28/elon-musks-shadow-rule"> wrote in a massive piece for the New Yorker</a> that pulled together many distinct threads from the last few years of his life. Musk has always equated &#8220;better for humanity&#8221; with &#8220;what&#8217;s good for Elon Musk,&#8221; turning off the Ukrainian Army&#8217;s access to Starlink internet to convince the US government to pay him (which, depressingly,<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/pentagon-to-pay-for-ukraines-starlink-after-elon-musk-complained-2023-6?r=US&amp;IR=T"> worked</a>) and having an approach that a former OSHA inspector called &#8220;ideologically opposed to the idea of government enforcement of public-health regulations.&#8221; Musk is the ultimate proof of what we get when we put our public trust in a private entity &#8212; an ugly, greedy, growth-hungry monster that endangers people so that a 52-year-old man can regard the results and say &#8220;interesting.&#8221;</p><p>Musk&#8217;s trajectory on Ukraine is a strange one. It&#8217;s not so much that it&#8217;s a &#8220;hero-to-villain&#8221; progression (though it is), but rather it illustrates an abject lack of any moral consistency, or rather, a worldview that&#8217;s seemingly uninfluenced by any new information or an immutable sense of &#8220;right&#8221; and &#8220;wrong&#8221;.</p><p>At the outset of the invasion, Musk stepped up. Credit where credit is due, his donation of thousands of Starlink units was an important humanitarian gesture that made a real difference to Ukrainian soldiers and noncombatants alike. When Russia besieged roughly 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers (and a similar number of civilians) in the crumbling ruins of the Azovstal Steel Works, blocking shipments of food and essential medicines, their<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/04/21/world/ukraine-russia-war-news"> only link to the outside world was through a Starlink terminal</a>. Musk was lauded as a hero, even<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/571884/zelensky-invites-elon-musk-ukraine/"> speaking to Zelensky</a>, where they agreed to collaborate on space projects after the war&#8217;s eventual end.</p><p>His subsequent actions have only served to eliminate any goodwill he earned during the earliest months of the war. Musk has proposed<a href="https://twitter.com/JimmySecUK/status/1644048712753356800?t=LPzpGxj6bkSd2vn9lzEkzQ&amp;s=19"> a Chamberlain-esque &#8220;peace plan&#8221;</a> that would see Ukraine surrender certain disputed territories, and require referendums in others. Those referendums &#8212; which would take place in areas under the control of the Russian military, and that have been re-populated with Russian nationals, itself<a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/customary-ihl/v2/rule130"> a war crime</a> &#8212; would be neither free nor fair. Ukraine would also be forced into a position of neutrality, unable to join NATO despite the wishes of its people, and with none of the collective security guarantees that protect the other nations that border Russia, like Poland and the Baltic states.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite well-documented atrocities perpetrated by the Russian military &#8212; which include the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucha_massacre"> Bucha</a> and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izium_mass_graves"> Izium massacres</a>, the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/03/kherson-supermarket-struck-russian-bombing-wave-ukraine"> indiscriminate bombings of civilians</a>, and<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2022/08/05/tracking-the-faceless-killers-who-mutilated-and-executed-a-ukrainian-pow/"> the torture and mutilation of POWs</a> &#8212; Musk has seen<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/08/21/elon-musk-starklink-internet-pulling-plug-ukraine-russia/"> fit to hold audiences with Vladimir Putin himself</a> (and<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1579879154463690752"> lied about doing so</a>). Under his stewardship, Twitter has<a href="https://twitter.com/JimmySecUK/status/1644048712753356800?t=LPzpGxj6bkSd2vn9lzEkzQ&amp;s=19"> amplified anti-Ukraine conspiracy theorists and propagandists</a>, and even<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/4/21/twitter-drops-state-affiliated-government-funded-labels"> removed the labels that identified Russian state-affiliated mouthpieces</a>. Moreover, he has imposed limits on <em>where</em> and <em>how</em> Starlink can be used, forcing the Ukraine government to request access for<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/10/13/politics/elon-musk-spacex-starlink-ukraine/"> each new kilometer of territory its military liberates</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Any intelligent person can see this, and see why it&#8217;s so damaging. And they can understand &#8212; on a basic moral level &#8212; that it&#8217;s wrong. But Musk&#8217;s notion of civic duty and civic virtue is inherently flexible and can bend to meet whatever he feels at that time, to align with those who like him (or he likes), or to oppose those he <em>dislikes</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Is this the man that we want to<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a39785992/elon-musk-tesla-robotaxi-2024/"> control our taxi networks</a>,<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-latest-mission-rev-up-the-electricity-industry-1583a184"> our power grid</a>, or America&#8217;s path to the rest of the galaxy?
