<blockquote><p>my friend Rebecca has been going through some rocky times, and  is currently homeless and dead broke in Boston.
she’s just trying to keep her head above the water until she can afford to leave.

if you have anything to give, her paypal is Rebeccaobrien1989@gmail.com.

you guys really came through for her last October, when we asked for your help. if you’re one of the people who contributed last time i made a post like this – thanks again.
