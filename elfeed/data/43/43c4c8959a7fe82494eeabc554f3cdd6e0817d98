<p><strong>Gundam Revival</strong><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">The World of Yoshiyuki Tomino</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-5f60ee6e786f238edfc9d81aa8426ef0">Yoshiyuki Tomino is a legend in the world of Japanese animation. He celebrated his 35th anniversary as a creator this year, and now he&#8217;s aiming to add yet another masterpiece to his repertoire. Twenty years have passed since the birth of <em>Mobile Suit Gundam</em>. <em>Turn A Gundam</em>, which is currently airing on Fuji TV, is an ambitious work that can be said to be Tomino&#8217;s own challenge to the existing worldview of <em>Gundam</em>. It&#8217;s about people who have forgotten about the existence of those living on the other side of the universe, and it involves the sudden appearance of mechanical dolls (mobile suits) in an idyllic countryside. Today we focus on his latest work, which is filled with unexpected things that overturn the conventional wisdom of robot animation.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p><strong>Ishizuka:</strong> Director Tomino, you have returned to the <em>Gundam</em> series after a long hiatus with your latest work, <em>Turn A Gundam</em>. What is the significance of the &#8220;∀&#8221;?</p>



<p><strong>Tomino:</strong> When I decided to start this project, I made it an absolute condition to completely deny all past <em>Gundam</em> series while also bringing them all together. I chose the name &#8220;Turn A Gundam&#8221; because it is both a new <em>Gundam</em> series as well as a return to its origins. The worldview of <em>Turn A</em> might seem different from previous <em>Gundam</em> series, but the fact is it combines all of those worldviews into one.</p>



<p><strong>Ishizuka:</strong> <em>Turn A </em>certainly gives a different impression than previous <em>Gundam</em> series. Were there any obstacles in creating this series?</p>



<p><strong>Tomino:</strong> Actually, thanks to <em>Turn A</em>, I was able to experience the joy of creation again. What I mean is that making something you like is not the same as creating a new story on your own. People who make things are generally egoists, and conversely—only egoists can make things. In the case of manga and animation, the words &#8220;what I like&#8221; and &#8220;my individuality&#8221; are deceiving. In fact, we often create stories within our own narrow worldviews to begin with. So in the case of animation, original works are always necessary. In other words, in a broad sense, it&#8217;s usually impossible to create a work without including elements of the writer&#8217;s own personality.</p>



<p>For the past fifteen years, I questioned whether or not I could call myself a writer. But this time, after trying to make a work on the premise of complete denial and affirmation, I realized that I really am not a writer. So when creating <em>Turn A</em>, I took a new approach. I asked several staff members to write some scenarios within the constraints of an overall plot structure, which naturally led to more detailed discussions. Of course, there were some people who didn&#8217;t want to deny nor affirm the former works in the way that was proposed, so there was a clash in ideology. Eventually, I gave the order to create a story that touched on the meaning of &#8220;∀&#8221;. I didn&#8217;t have time to write the entire plot myself. On top of that, the storytelling technique would&#8217;ve been too narrow if it was written by someone with no writing talent, so that&#8217;s why I chose not to write it by myself.</p>



<p><strong>Ishizuka:</strong> So during production, you had others write the initial scenario, and then you made additional changes to further mature it?</p>



<p><strong>Tomino:</strong> Yes, and after realizing these scenarios into animated form, I eventually reached a point where the &#8220;Gundam&#8221; title felt meaningless to me. I came to this realization by the 34th episode (episode #35 in the TV broadcast, since there was one compilation episode). I felt that was I able to do this by taking an approach that was different from what I had done before. Deny and affirm all the <em>Gundam</em> series. Then, distribute that plot into twenty-one or twenty-two minute episodes. I thought, &#8220;Oh, this is another way to make TV animation.&#8221; I felt like I had touched the literary arts for the first time.</p>



<p><strong>Ishizuka:</strong> Did this cause any internal conflicts for you? Specifically, where does this &#8220;literary art&#8221; appear?</p>



<p><strong>Tomino:</strong> It all happens in my mind, so ordinary people probably won&#8217;t be able to see it on-screen. I can only tell myself, &#8220;This is what a good story is like&#8221;, or &#8220;This is what a novel is like&#8221;. Even if at the end of the day it&#8217;s just one episode of a TV series, like a book without a clear ending. I didn&#8217;t think I would have made it to the level where I thought &#8220;I&#8217;ll do this with anime!&#8221; By episode #34 (#35), we finally reached the point where they leave Earth for space. If you focus on the imagery alone, it looks like a standard robot anime, and I think it&#8217;s difficult for viewers to understand all the intricacies. However, for me this episode was amazing.</p>

Director Tomino explains the importance of storyboards, saying &#8220;Most of the production is determined by the storyboard.&#8221;</figcaption></figure></div>


<p><strong>Ishizuka:</strong> Was it your goal to be able to express your anime as a literary work?</p>



<p><strong>Tomino:</strong> I have always wanted to make live-action films, and I&#8217;ve always admired literary creations. <em>Gundam</em> is said to have set the standard for how to make robot anime. But if you continue using that same format for fifteen years, it becomes questionable if you can create new long-lasting works that stand the test of time. I realized that I would never learn how to create such works unless I actually tried to do so myself. If there&#8217;s only one role left for me, then it is my responsibility to create something that can serve as a guide. I tried with <em>Turn A</em> and thought &#8220;Oh, maybe I can do this!&#8221; </p>



<p>I also don&#8217;t think many people would come up with the idea of starting with a large conceptual story, like denying or affirming an entire TV franchise. This series makes an effort to never touch an arrangement theory. If I tried to approach the work as an arrangement, I knew I would fail. I already have professional intuition, and for the first time in twenty years that intuition kicked in. Working on a TV series like this has made me realize that <em>Turn A</em> is definitely not a continuous job for me. That&#8217;s why the meaning and significance I can put into it is substantial. I think I&#8217;ve been able to illustrate the idea that in the future, even if everyone were to make every part of an entire anime, down to the storyboards, that there would still be things to keep in mind. In any case, <em>Turn A</em> is completely different.</p>



<p><strong>Ishizuka:</strong> What exactly is the difference?</p>



<p><strong>Tomino:</strong> For example, there are settings that are typical to science fiction or robot anime, but this time I took the stage to World War I. I also did it without using common tropes like time travel. Also, the distinction between ally and enemy remains unclear, and I make no attempt to clarify it in a single story plotline. In particular, with episodes #34 (35) and #26 (27) I think I was able to show the structure of the story itself, rather than just a battle. Maybe it&#8217;s due to my age, but I felt that these episodes were finished with a literary taste. The same could be said of the first two episodes&#8230; </p>



<p><strong>Ishizuka:</strong> I was surprised by the idyllic rural scenery in the first two episodes. Even the design work has changed, hasn&#8217;t it?</p>



<p><strong>Tomino:</strong> In terms of production, bringing on Syd Mead as the mechanical designer was a major factor. In the twenty years I&#8217;ve worked on <em>Gundam</em>, I&#8217;ve had various designers arrange the characters, but they always felt like arrangements instead of design. I told Bandai that if they were going to make a special series commemorating the 20th anniversary, that they should bring Syd Mead on board, and in the end they did. He has a brand name as a 1960s designer. When it comes to <em>Gundam</em> design, the style hasn&#8217;t differed much over the course of twenty years. I wondered what a 1960s designer with his level of foundational skill would be able to provide.</p>



<p>Akira Yasuda, who did the character design, initially wanted to enter the animation industry, but at this point he has been working in the video game industry for so long now. As a person with such a tenured background, he brings a brand new perspective. When I first approached him about the <em>Turn A</em> project, he said &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s a good idea.&#8221; He also said, &#8220;When I saw the story of <em>Turn A</em>, I realized that this is the type of story I&#8217;ve wanted to see.&#8221; When I heard Yasuda say this, I realized there was something I wanted to tell young people: it doesn&#8217;t matter what you make, whether it is <em>Gundam</em>, robot anime, or science fiction, as long as you express it in your own individual way. It can be frustrating at times, but that&#8217;s what makes it &#8220;literary art&#8221;, isn&#8217;t it? If you don&#8217;t understand this part of literature, you can&#8217;t actually make robot or monster stories. I&#8217;ve finally reached the point that it feels wrong to create art without this mindset. It&#8217;s embarrassing to admit this at my age, but somebody needs to come out and say it. Otherwise we will continue to parrot things like &#8220;If you want to make a monster movie, just make something like <em>Godzilla</em>.&#8221; <em>Turn A</em> is my current proposal and response to that mentality.</p>
