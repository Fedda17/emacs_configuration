But what he really meant was how I write so often and on such a broad array of topics.</p><p>Well, it&#8217;s a slow news week, so I thought I&#8217;d write a post about how I approach my job as an opinion writer. In fact, this will be the third in a series of posts I&#8217;ve written on this general topic &#8212; the first two were about <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/noah-smiths-writing-advice">how to be a professional writer</a>, and the second was about <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/how-to-write-a-successful-substack">how to make a Substack newsletter successful</a>. This one will be less about the process and the marketing, and more about how I actually create the content. I&#8217;ll cover:</p><ul><li><p>My general conception of how an opinion writer adds value </p></li><li><p>How I decide what to write about</p></li><li><p>Where I get my information &#8212; what I read and who I talk to </p></li><li><p>How I actually communicate my thoughts</p></li><li><p>Some pitfalls I try to avoid</p></li></ul><h4>The opinion writer as public-domain CIA analyst</h4><p>&#8220;Opinion writer&#8221; is not really a good term for what I do. Although Americans tend to use the word &#8220;opinion&#8221; to mean anything that people argue about, what I mostly offer are actually <em>assessments</em> &#8212; <em>explanations</em> for why I think the world works the way it does, <em>forecasts</em> for how I think things might go in the future, <em>conditional predictions</em> about the effects of various policy choices, and <em>recommendations</em> about how to achieve certain goals. </p><p>This has to do with my own goals as a writer. Some writers are basically crusaders for a certain ideology or point of view, and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that. I&#8217;m just a little different; I have a certain way I&#8217;d like the world to be, but most of all I just want to see the world be better-informed. Basically I&#8217;m just the guy in <a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">this famous XKCD comic</a>:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F845a5d6a-938f-440f-a557-1f5ae88336b9_300x330.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F845a5d6a-938f-440f-a557-1f5ae88336b9_300x330.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F845a5d6a-938f-440f-a557-1f5ae88336b9_300x330.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F845a5d6a-938f-440f-a557-1f5ae88336b9_300x330.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F845a5d6a-938f-440f-a557-1f5ae88336b9_300x330.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F845a5d6a-938f-440f-a557-1f5ae88336b9_300x330.jpeg" width="300" height="330" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/845a5d6a-938f-440f-a557-1f5ae88336b9_300x330.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:330,&quot;width&quot;:300,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:25390,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F845a5d6a-938f-440f-a557-1f5ae88336b9_300x330.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F845a5d6a-938f-440f-a557-1f5ae88336b9_300x330.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F845a5d6a-938f-440f-a557-1f5ae88336b9_300x330.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F845a5d6a-938f-440f-a557-1f5ae88336b9_300x330.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>This doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m a dispassionate robot who just tells people the facts and lets them decide what to do with them. I do actually include a fair amount of true opinion in my writing &#8212; if I think <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/our-climate-change-debates-are-out">climate change is an important problem</a>, or <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/is-it-time-for-the-revenge-of-the">a more egalitarian society is good</a>, or <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/whos-afraid-of-the-huawei-mate-60">Chinese military power is a menace</a>, I&#8217;m going to let you know. But I see this as also being part of the process of informing people &#8212; if you know what kind of world I&#8217;d like to achieve, then you&#8217;ll have a better idea of whether to listen to my recommendations.</p><p>As I&#8217;ve <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/five-big-trends-that-have-changed">written before</a>, I think of what I do as being closely akin to what a CIA analyst does. I didn&#8217;t have any idea what CIA analysts did until I read the book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Revolt-Public-Crisis-Authority-Millennium/dp/1732265143">The Revolt of the Public</a></em>, by Martin Gurri, who held that role himself. Basically, what CIA analysts do is to take in a large amount of information from CIA agents, figure out what it all means, and synthesize it into a fairly simple, comprehensible, and actionable narrative for their higher-ups.</p><p>When I read that, I realized that I basically do the same thing &#8212; I read a bunch of books and papers and blogs and social media posts, and I try to synthesize those into narratives that the general public understands. Journalists and academics are like my agents in the field, gathering the primary information. Sometimes I dig into the details to check what they send me, but I can&#8217;t always afford to do that; usually I have to decide which information-gatherers to trust. And instead of higher-ups in the government, I have you, the public. </p><p>I am the middleman, and you are my boss. </p><p>Informing the world isn&#8217;t just what I <em>want</em> to do; it&#8217;s also what you <em>pay</em> me to do. It&#8217;s the value I provide, because people want to feel better-informed. I think this is true even of the more ideological opinion writers out there &#8212; if you&#8217;re a socialist reading Jacobin or a libertarian reading Reason, you still want to understand the world better, you just want to understand it from a certain ideological vantage point. So if you&#8217;re an aspiring opinion writer, this should be the first question you think about: &#8220;How can I make the world better informed?&#8221;</p><p>The first step is to decide <em>what</em> to inform the world about.</p><h4>What to write about</h4>
