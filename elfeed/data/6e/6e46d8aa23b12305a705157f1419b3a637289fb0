However, role of the Senate is quite limited - and as it&#39;s already controlled by the opposition during the ending term, this is expected to repeat, as the &quot;democratic opposition&quot; (see below) made an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Pact_2023">agreement</a> to not compete with each other (one candidate fielded per constituency). <del>It&#39;s expected opposition will win Senate roughly 58-60 vs 38-40.</del> Update: opposition won 67 vs 32 (+1 independent).</li> </ul> <p>Polls open on 07:00, and close on 21:00 local time.
