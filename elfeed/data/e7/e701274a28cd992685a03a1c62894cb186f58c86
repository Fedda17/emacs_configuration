This &#8220;move fast and break things&#8221; methodology has never faced off against America&#8217;s financial regulators, who wield a great deal more power than the opponents he&#8217;s faced previously because <em>the American government needs you to handle money in a very, very specific way.</em></p><blockquote><p><strong>Learning Corner: </strong>Musk&#8217;s obsession with X.com comes from one of his first companies (also called X.com), an early online bank that was fraught with infighting, eventually merging with Confinity (retaining the X.com name), a competitor that had a peer-to-peer payments product called &#8220;PayPal.&#8221; M<a href="http://snopes.com/fact-check/was-elon-musk-fired-from-paypal/">usk would eventually get ousted as CEO while on his honeymoon</a> because everybody else realized that PayPal &#8212; which it immediately changed the name to &#8212; was a viable business and a better product.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/4038979-why-senators-are-concerned-about-twitters-data-security/">Musk&#8217;s lax approach to data security and privacy</a> will immediately become a problem if &#8220;X&#8221; decides to handle anyone&#8217;s money<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/10/23452488/elon-musk-twitter-bank-q-and-a"> as he has suggested in the past</a>. And even if he&#8217;s capable of delivering this non-existent and entirely theoretical product,<a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/en-in/news-and-trends/founders-are-sceptical-about-fintech-profitability-says/433676"> FinTech is rarely profitable</a>, with payments &#8212; the specific thing that Musk is discussing &#8212;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/25/venmo-discloses-huge-digital-user-base-but-no-plan-to-profit-from-it.html"> having some of the thinnest margins</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Regulators are also extremely aggressive in fining financial services companies that fail to protect their customers from fraud, and Musk&#8217;s track record is terrible.<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2593967/online-bank--lax-security-opened-door-for-thieves.html"> In 2000, X.com allowed thieves to steal tens of thousands of dollars from customers because X didn&#8217;t verify the details of the bank they were withdrawing funds to</a>. A security consultant referred to the breach as &#8220;an appalling lack of security.&#8221;</p><p>It&#8217;s worth emphasizing the logistical complexity of what Musk is proposing. In order to build a globe-spanning fintech app, X would have to obtain licenses in every jurisdiction it operates in, and then build or acquire the rails necessary to connect the app to the local banking network. As McKinsey points out, fintech rules <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/europes-fintech-opportunity">vary wildly between states</a>, even in places like Europe where legislation is often created on a supranational basis by the EU. Some markets (like Germany) are easier than others (like Poland) to enter.&nbsp;</p><p>And it would need to adhere to financial services regulations on an ongoing basis, which adds further headaches, both from a legal and engineering perspective. Things like AML (anti-money laundering) and KYC (know your customer) rules differ subtly between states, and violations can result in tough financial or criminal penalties. Staying compliant requires spending money and hiring people &#8212; both of which Musk has proven averse to &#8212; and can&#8217;t be accomplished through automation alone.&nbsp;</p><p>Musk dreams of creating the WeChat or KakaoTalk of America &#8212; massive apps combining payments, social media and chat, created by different companies in different countries with different regulatory climates <em>at different times in history.</em> They are capital-intensive apps with massive payrolls. Kakao has 10,000 employees, and Tencent (which owns WeChat) has over 100,000 people and grew WeChat from its already-successful and stable QQ chat (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/223719/number-of-tencent-group-employees/">and had over 20,000 people at launch</a>). By contrast, Twitter employs roughly 1,000 people &#8212; a fraction of its pre-acquisition headcount.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#8217;s a dream that&#8217;s almost comically ignorant of history and context. WeChat, for example, which blends social media and fintech into a single product, and is <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wechat-statistics/">the de-facto payment method in the Middle Kingdom</a>. This app was successful largely because, for most of its modern history, China was <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2021/06/in-china-cashless-is-king/">a cash-centric country with a rudimentary banking system</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The first domestic debit card system, UnionPay, launched in 2003, almost four decades after Barclays bank introduced the world&#8217;s first ATM system. Before then, cards <a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/china-economic-watch/how-china-leapfrogged-ahead-united-states-fintech-race">only worked in the cities where they were issued</a>, and were rarely accepted by merchants. Credit cards came to China in 1985, almost 35 years after their creation, and were limited to the most affluent in society. Again, widespread adoption was limited.&nbsp;</p><p>And although China has gradually opened up its economy to the wider world (starting with the reforms of Deng Xiaoping in 1979 and accelerating after China&#8217;s accession into the World Trade Organization in 2001), the country has long resisted the introduction foreign payments providers. For context, Mastercard <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/mastercard-given-approval-to-prepare-for-entry-into-chinas-payments-market/">only received approval to offer bank clearing services in 2020</a>, and only after it agreed to form a joint venture with local companies. The same is true for American Express, which <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/09/business/american-express-china/index.html">received permission in 2018</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This history matters because it explains how WeChat became so successful. Tencent had an unbelievable advantage &#8212; a perfectly straight and clear path to victory. It had a vast, untapped market to exploit and virtually no competition (either foreign or domestic) to worry about. There was no way it could lose.&nbsp;</p><p>X, meanwhile, is seeking to disrupt an established and highly-competitive market, where its rivals include Mastercard, Visa, Apple, Samsung, Google, Paypal, CashApp, Venmo, and more. These companies aren&#8217;t merely richer and better-managed than Twitter &#8212; but arguably more popular and trusted. And whereas Tencent only had to deal with one regulator, X must deal with potentially <em>hundreds</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>It almost feels farcical to humor Musk&#8217;s idea, because he simply does not execute. His ideas are always half-baked and vague, then handed off to cronies that will then have to find a way to build them into something functional. He&#8217;s the world&#8217;s highest-paid ideas guy, making ridiculous claims and then<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/18/elon-musk-twitter-billionaire-awful-boss"> treating the people that have to deliver with contempt</a> while continually hogging the spotlight.</p><p>And what&#8217;s important to realize is that <em><strong>absolutely nothing has changed about Twitter other than the name the company is using.</strong></em> There is no product roadmap, no new features promised, no new hires, and no new product. Linda Yaccarino said that X, &#8220;powered by AI,&#8221; will &#8220;connect us all in ways we&#8217;re just beginning to imagine,&#8221; a statement that, even charitably-read, means that they are barely coming up with ideas as to what the hell &#8220;unlimited interactivity&#8221; means.</p><p>My prediction is that this rebrand is an attempt by Musk to convince investors to put more capital into a bleeding company, juicing the valuation with promises of &#8220;AI&#8221; and &#8220;connectivity.&#8221; I don&#8217;t believe for a second that this is part of a plan or a strategy. It&#8217;s just more rot economics from The Rot King, a man who has learned exactly what to say and do in order to exploit the markets and media for the minimal amount of effort. And many in the Valley love him because he symbolizes what some founders strive for &#8212; appreciation for his existence rather than any specific achievement or contribution to society.</p><p>Even if he succeeds in raising funds, building the kind of app he wants to will be extremely difficult, expensive and unprofitable, while attracting the ire of regulators that would love the opportunity to punish him.</p><p>And that&#8217;s before you realize that Facebook is, on some level, already the &#8220;Everything App.&#8221; It&#8217;s a social network with video, audio, chat and<a href="https://pay.facebook.com/messenger/"> payments already built in</a>, all without having to transact on a network that can&#8217;t go two weeks without a major bug or outage. We&#8217;ve already got the app, man, and it sucks.</p><div><hr></div><p>Musk is the loser&#8217;s winner &#8212; a charlatan that is able to make unfathomable amounts of money despite being nakedly full of shit, using his massive fame and fortune to test society and the markets&#8217; limits. He believes he can get away with anything <em>because he always has</em>, other than one major exception &#8212; Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>He didn&#8217;t want to buy it, and now it sits there, festering, burning capital and constantly activating his worst instincts, showing the world how much of a rotten little cretin he is.</p><p>The &#8220;Everything App&#8221; is Musk&#8217;s last desperate attempt to turn Twitter into something valuable again before selling it off. Without a significant capital injection, all we&#8217;ll see is a poorly-designed payment integration that leads to the site breaking and someone losing money due to an obvious bug caused by rushed development timelines.</p><p>And I really believe that this will lead to a reckoning for Musk. Twitter burns money, and even adding video and audio to the platform will massively increase both development and<a href="https://medium.com/codex/twitters-owner-elon-musk-refuses-to-pay-google-cloud-bill-8e0ec1030101"> cloud storage costs that he&#8217;s already struggling with</a>. If he actually makes good on any kind of financial services product, he will turn Twitter into a black hole for capital, one that may very well tank the entire company.</p><p>Thankfully,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/apr/20/elon-musks-spacex-launches-test-flight-for-rocket-that-could-bring-people-to-mars"> he&#8217;s got a lot of experience with his products blowing up</a>.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wheresyoured.at/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Ed Zitron's Where's Your Ed At!
