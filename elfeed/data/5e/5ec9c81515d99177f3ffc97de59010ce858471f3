<p>China&#8217;s blue-chip CSI 300 Index jumped roughly 3% on Monday after the country confirmed a Reuters scoop on slashing stamp duty on stock trading. Reuters <strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-plans-cut-stamp-duty-stock-trading-by-up-50-revive-sentiment-sources-2023-08-25/">exclusively reported</a></strong> that Chinese authorities were planning to cut stamp duty on stock trading by as much as 50% in a further attempt to revitalize the country&#8217;s struggling stock market. The proposed cut comes after China&#8217;s leaders vowed in late July to reinvigorate the world&#8217;s second-largest stock market, which has been reeling as the country&#8217;s economic recovery flags and a debt crisis in the property market deepens. China&#8217;s fiscal revenue totalled 20.37 trillion yuan ($3.02 trillion) last year, with 276 billion yuan or 1.35% contributed by stamp duty on securities transactions, official data showed. The finance ministry, in a brief statement on Sunday, said it was reducing the 0.1% duty on stock trades by 50% &#8220;in order to invigorate the capital market and boost investor confidence.” </p>
