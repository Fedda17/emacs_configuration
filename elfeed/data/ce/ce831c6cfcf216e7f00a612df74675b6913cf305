<p>No one in the world seems to know how Google's privacy controls work, and the company probably likes it that way. The latest example is from <em>Rodriguez v. Google,</em> an ongoing 2021 class-action lawsuit over Google's infamous "Web &amp; App Activity" privacy check box.

<p>The expert witness, Jonathan Hochman, called Google's "Web &amp; App Activity" check box "a fake control, because it doesn't doâ€”technically doesn't do what it seems it should do." Hochman later said, "It looks like even Sundar Pichai is confused about how this control works because he testified in front of Congress and told them something that is just wrong from a technical perspective."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978270#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978270&comments=1">Comments</a></p>
