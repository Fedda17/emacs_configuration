<p><strong>ENCOUNTERING MEAD AT TURN A</strong><br>By general director Yoshiyuki Tomino</p>



<p>The January 2000 issue of <em>Playboy</em> magazine, also known as its &#8220;Millennium Issue&#8221;, featured an article about a futuristic living space by Mr. Syd Mead. The concept behind the design was a &#8220;sophisticated pod&#8221;, where one could find peace and relaxation. The illustrations of the exterior and interior of the spaceship cabin were presented in a youthful and playful manner, just as Mr. Mead&#8217;s &#8220;Land Yacht&#8221; had been presented in <em>Playboy</em> 30 years ago. The &#8220;Land Yacht&#8221; was my first introduction to Mr. Mead, and I quickly fell in love with his work.</p>



<p>I was concerned about the 67 year-old artist, because I thought he had lost his drive and motivation over the years. I was worried that <em>Turn A Gundam</em> might be his last workâ€”it would be a shame for such a wonderful and creative career to end with an anime robot project. Those were my thoughts two years ago. I was happy to see his illustrations again in <em>Playboy</em> magazine, which he did after his work on <em>Turn A</em> had concluded. This might sound like I&#8217;m bragging, but Mr. Mead may have been revitalized by <em>Turn A</em> and is now doing well and working again. Either which way, I was incredibly happy.</p>



<p><em>Turn A</em> was not my first encounter with Mr. Syd Mead. He was commissioned to draw a poster during the <em>Zeta Gundam</em> era, so we became somewhat acquainted back then. I myself had gone through a decline in health after <em>Victory Gundam</em>, so I could relate to the grief of a person struggling with his work while fighting what felt like death. Seeing Mr. Mead&#8217;s work in <em>Playboy</em> again really brought me joy.</p>

<p><strong>STUDIO WORK</strong></p>



<p>When I first approached Mr. Mead about working on <em>Turn A</em>, I asked his manager Mieko Ichikawa to be cautious of his health and to take good care of him. She scolded me and said that he was &#8220;aware of his age&#8221; and told me not say anything unnecessary, as they had not just casually accepted to work with us. When the project began, she and I were not on the best terms. I&#8217;ve also made her cry once.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know if Mr. Mead knew about this, but I was frequently warned by Mr. Shigeru Horiguchi and Mr. Shigeru Moritaâ€”Sunrise&#8217;s producers for mechanical order management and science fiction research, respectivelyâ€”that conducting the overall project with Mr. Mead&#8217;s team would be difficult. I can&#8217;t thank them enough for providing him all the history from the Okawara era of <em>Gundam</em> to contextualize the modern science fiction setting. As the project progressed, Mr. Katsumi Kawaguchi from Bandai had plenty of constructive criticism to provide, and Mr. Atsushi Shigeta edited the master drawings for animation purposes. For a designer it must have been frustrating to see his work constantly manipulated and changed by animators, without the animation process having even started. I&#8217;ve seen other designers angrily call it quits before in such a situation. Mr. Mead was really patient with us.</p>



<p>As far as my role is concerned, I really only had the plot and bigger themes of the show ready. At times, I&#8217;d voice my opinions on technical aspects, but in terms of making the mechanical and character settings work together, I have to give credit to Ms. Tetsuko Takahashi and Mr. Yoshitakawa Kawaguchi from literary production. It was important for Mr. Mead to understand that even the design of a single mobile suit would require a lot of additional studio work. We wanted him to view the production environment similarly to that of a Hollywood movie&#8217;s. The show was not just my work, but a project involving a rich and long history. That&#8217;s why we also had Mr. Mead meet with Mr. Kunio Okawara to gain an understanding of Okawara&#8217;s design philosophy, and to analyze its faults and shortcomings.</p>



<p>We didn&#8217;t personally discuss these matters in an attempt to woo him over with the validity of the project. I had faith in Mr. Mead&#8217;s professionalism, so there was no need to actively expose him to the studio environment. What I wanted to do was simply put pressure on him and show him that we wouldn&#8217;t accept &#8220;elderly lousy work&#8221;. </p>



<p>As expected, Mr. Mead understood our intentions and humbly took time out of his busy schedule to meet with us. He was also always ready to present new rough drafts based on previous discussion ideas.</p>



<p>I look back on these moments fondly as a very fruitful time. To this day, I cannot think of another designer who would do this.</p>



<p>It pains me to say this, but our Tokyo staff today has people who are either too young, too arrogant, or too timid to properly respond to requests. They tend to draw whatever they want to and try to take ownership of every little thing. They don&#8217;t understand what it means to work together as studio staff.</p>



<p>Mr. Mead was a professional who worked hard with us in the studio, despite the challenging distance caused by the Pacific Ocean. He really taught us an incredibly valuable lesson. If you have the ability to perform, then you have an ability to understand. If you have this ability to understand, then you can work with any age group. We learned from his greatnessâ€”the power to be humble and to cater to all needs.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p><strong>WORKING WITH CULTURE</strong></p>



<p>The actual design work can be understood by examining the progress sketches and finished designs in this book, so there&#8217;s no need to go into additional detail. The one thing I will say is that some readers will immediately be able to see all the important details, and those who can&#8217;t need to train their eyes and hearts.</p>



<p>However, there are some points that need to be made.</p>



<p>It was exciting to work with someone from a different culture and to really experience our overwhelming differences. It reminded me that the problems we often conceptualize are due to our limited perspectives. The idea of being &#8220;unique&#8221; is really just a consequence of the culture and society in which one is raised. However, even if the values we believe in are narrow-minded, we have no choice but to live by them. Most of our lives are spent sticking to one&#8217;s beliefs.</p>



<p>That said, even if life may be that way, the creative process is something entirely else. Those who are bound by one set of values or have a narrow mindset cannot create something new. If you look back on history, most of the genius creators we know have not been bound by old restrictions. And if you don&#8217;t have talent, you can at least create something new by looking for new inspirations. This is what ordinary people do.</p>



<p>Take for example Japanese artist Kaii Higashiyama, who passed away last year. Two years before World War II he went abroad to study Western art history in Germany, and it&#8217;s said that this experience allowed him to develop a new style of Japanese art. The old Japanese military&#8217;s &#8220;Zero-san&#8221; and &#8220;Battleship Yamato&#8221; were not all-original ideas, as they were developed by Japanese people who took Western technology and brought it back to Japan. Nothing is really original, if you examine it like this.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s nothing novel about this type of human pattern, but apparently people in today&#8217;s <em>Gundam</em> World have forgotten such a simple concept. We have allowed 20 years to pass without any significant changes to the &#8220;Gundam&#8221; design. People are afraid to incorporate new ideas and to use their imagination, and as a result had not been able to create anything more than design arrangements. I can say that my imagination was not triggered and that I was letting it run dry.</p>



<p>What if I were to say that I only view the &#8220;Honda S800&#8221;, the &#8220;Toyota 2000GT&#8221;, and Morgan&#8217;s open two-seater as acceptable cars? In reality though I drive a lame [Toyota] &#8220;Crown&#8221;. I can&#8217;t stand the thing, but it&#8217;s the best I can do. There are so many better options out there though.</p>



<p>People find that one thing in their lives that they think they own and live through it. This is human nature, but itâ€™s a complete mistake to assume that anything is their own and original product. It probably comes from our desire to be special, which is really just a defense mechanism.</p>



<p>The new Volkswagen Beetle is a nice car. The MRS looks pretty darn cool.</p>



<p>Unless you are a genius, there is no such thing as originality. So as a result, different types of martial arts are necessary to spice up the mundane. We in Tokyo live in a catalog world, driven by specs and regulations, and we seem to have forgotten this obvious fact. It was our experience working with Mr. Mead that allowed us to reflect on all this.</p>



<p>The same goes for Mr. Mead. I&#8217;m sure there were many times where he was fed up with us, alone in his office, screaming &#8220;those bastards from Tokyo!&#8221; The fact that he often did not answer his phone is proof of this.</p>



<p>As you probably know from published articles, the initial &#8220;Turn A&#8221; design is a result of us requesting something resembling the Zero-sen (Mitsubishi A6M Zero) but instead we received something more akin to the Grumman (Grumman F6F Hellcat). After many discussions, this design ended up being repurposed into the current SUMO. There was a need to educate Mr. Mead.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, I still appreciate the beauty of the SUMO&#8217;s design. It is the epitome of how two cultures meshed together and produced something noteworthy. We allowed it to be used as an enemy suit, just like the Grumman was during the Pacific War.</p>



<p>Mr. Horiguchi had to fly to Los Angeles more than once, as it is impossible to communicate everything through fax. Action can often times speak louder than words. This was especially true during the &#8220;Turn X&#8221; naming process. Mr. Mead understood the premise behind the Turn A, and yet, as a joke, he&#8217;d sometimes throw out the word &#8220;<em>Turn X</em>&#8220;. We on the Tokyo side interpreted it as a joke as well, but eventually we began to see it as an actual name that could be adopted within the story itself. This was not something that would have materialized by a mere exchange of documents, since we had to spend time eating okonomiyaki and drinking sakÃ© together.</p>



<p>As soon as word reached Los Angeles that the name &#8220;Turn X&#8221; was becoming legitimized, Mr. Mead felt more weight in his designs. The results can be seen in this book.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p><strong>DESIGN WORK</strong></p>



<p>Even Mr. Mead isn&#8217;t perfect and has his own quirks, and this occasionally causes some problems. For instance, the SUMO was supposed to be from a completely different culture, yet ultimately it ended up looking too similar to all the other mobile suits. This is a critical failure on my part and the literary staff&#8217;s in establishing <em>Turn A</em>&#8216;s narrative and setting. After all, the SUMO&#8217;s design was completed very early in production. We were so focused on communicating with Mr. Mead that we overlooked some of his design quirks. We were too caught up in readying the production process.</p>



<p>Similarly, the Mobile Rib was designed under a lot of pressure. The studio knew that if we did everything as Mead suggested, we&#8217;d run out of time. That&#8217;s why I simply told him to put tires and caterpillars on it. The completed Mobile Rib was not a finished design and as a result its purpose in the story remained ambiguous. I can&#8217;t apologize enough to Mr. Mead for such an experience.</p>



<p>Eventually, &#8220;Car Styling&#8221;, the only magazine in Japan dedicated to car design, took an interest in <em>Turn A</em> and heavily featured the series in one of their issues. I hope readers of this book will understand the significance of such an event and understand what we learned through this work.</p>



<p>The questions that cannot be answered are: &#8220;What is design? What purpose does it serve?&#8221; I&#8217;m actually the least qualified person to begin answering these questions. What I&#8217;ve learned though is that any tool that is used by a person usually ends up looking as it&#8217;s meant to be.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the philosophy that if a function of a device is clearly visible, then it is most likely beautiful. That&#8217;s why it is infuriating to me that stealth aircraft go against this philosophy of aircraft design. But the fact remains that &#8220;simple is best&#8221;.</p>



<p>I had told Mr. Mead that the mechanics of mobile suits were completely imaginaryâ€”he could do anything he&#8217;d wanted. Yet, Mr. Mead still kept it simple and made sure all the fundamental lines connected and made sense. It&#8217;s a nod to the principle that evolved forms become more baroque in style.</p>



<p>Today, we as animators are being suffocated by the overabundance in style caused by the modern CG environment. But is that really a bad thing? It&#8217;s up to the individual to consider the pros and cons and decide.</p>



<p>Although creating something new is an original process, it is absolutely necessary to have basic relevant foundational skills to create anything of value. And to further cultivate these skills, one must have an open mind and broaden their perspective. That&#8217;s how I will summarize my experience working with Mr. Mead.</p>



<p>At the same time, even with the advent of Mr. Mead&#8217;s <em>Turn A </em>designs, the Okawara Gundams will remain immortal in the business industry and in the history of design.</p>



<p>I wish you all the best.</p>
