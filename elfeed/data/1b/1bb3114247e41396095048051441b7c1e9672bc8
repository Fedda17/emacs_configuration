<p>Reddit ignited a war this year. Dramatic changes in API access pricing (from free to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/reddits-api-pricing-results-in-shocking-20-million-a-year-bill-for-apollo/">unaffordable</a>) was one of its most polarizing moves ever. It resulted in apps beloved by long-time Reddit users, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/are-reddits-replacement-mods-fit-to-fight-misinformation/">moderators</a> and people with accessibility needs, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/reddit-api-changes-are-imminent-heres-whats-happening-to-your-favorite-apps/">closing shop</a>. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/the-reddit-protests-are-winding-down-so-whats-next/">Community trust</a> was sacrificed, too.

<p>Originally, Reddit framed its API pricing changes as a way to prevent generative AI companies from using Reddit data to train large language models (LLMs) without Reddit getting anything in return. With Reddit no longer dealing with small third-party developers—all of which are now either paying Reddit or getting some sort of exemption—Reddit is reportedly taking the fight to where it should have been focused the entire time: generative AI firms.</p>
<h2>Can Reddit survive without search?</h2>
<p>On Friday, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/10/20/artificial-intelligence-battle-online-data/">The Washington Post</a>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/20/23925504/reddit-deny-force-log-in-see-posts-ai-companies-deals">The Verge</a>, said Reddit "has met with top generative AI companies about being paid for its data," citing an anonymous source.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977935#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977935&comments=1">Comments</a></p>
