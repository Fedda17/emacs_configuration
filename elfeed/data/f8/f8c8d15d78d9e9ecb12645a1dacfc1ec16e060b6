<p><a href="https://nitter.rawbit.ninja/As70HmOoM77vhBv" title="大橋 明">@As70HmOoM77vhBv</a>....Mr. Akira Ohashi, has given us all some VERY memorable kaiju performances and thrills as an action director and stuntman of AAC STUNTS 😃<br>
He hopes that his latest work in HOSHI 35 will "...reach people who love Japanese monster movies overseas."<br>
WE DO TOO‼️👍</p>
