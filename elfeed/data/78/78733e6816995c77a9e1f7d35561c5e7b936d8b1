<p>Hey everyone!<p>I am an enthusiast trader and a year ago I had this idea to create a free-to-use website that would feature all the most essential tools that traders would use on a daily basis.<p>So I learned to code and build it—I did everything including design, texts, code, and SEO—which took me 12 months to launch and a year and a half to make it look like it currently does.<p>I was into marketing and design before, but I didn't know barely anything about coding. The website is built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Typescript with Framer Motion animations and lots of APIs.<p>I’m actively working on the project and in the following months I will release a huge update that will feature a renewed interface and access to real time on chain data and analytics.<p>Feel free to ask any questions and thanks a lot for reading this, it means a lot to me. Any feedback and your opinions would be highly appreciated.</p>
