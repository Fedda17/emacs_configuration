<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Kia provided flights from Los Angeles to Seoul and three nights in a hotel so we could see the EV3, EV4, and EV5. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>Following the launch of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/heres-our-first-look-at-kias-ev9-three-row-electric-suv/">the new EV9</a>, the next product in Kia's EV onslaught is the smaller EV5. And while the first round of EV5s will go on sale in China and South Korea in the coming months, it will still be some time before the compact SUV is offered globally.</p>
<p>Even worse, we aren't totally sure if the EV5 will come to America; sources within Kia have both confirmed and denied plans to bring this SUV to the US. The company's president and CEO said it would be headed stateside, but then Kia's public relations team denied this statement, with other internal sources saying the EV5 would not be offered in the US. Kia confirms that the EV5 will come to North America, but we're told this just means Canada and possibly Mexico.</p>
<p>Why? It's complicated. The likely culprit is that the EV5 isn't planned to be built in North America, making it ineligible for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/01/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-ev-tax-credit-for-2023/">the new Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credit</a>. That $7,500 credit could drastically reduce the price of a new EV, and Kia not being able to make use of this would reduce the EV5's competitiveness in the US. Just a thought.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975385#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975385&comments=1">Comments</a></p>
