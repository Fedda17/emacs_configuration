<p>KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla.—The launch window for one of the most expensive robotic space missions in NASA's history opens one year from Tuesday. Coming in at $5 billion, Europa Clipper will try to help scientists answer a bold question commensurate with its eye-popping cost: Are there places below the surface of Jupiter’s icy moon, Europa, that could support life?</p>
<p>Europa is slightly smaller than Earth's Moon, and is significantly more interesting to scientists searching for life. The icy world harbors a vast global ocean of liquid water underneath a frozen crust. Clipper will sail past Europa nearly 50 times, coming as close as 16 miles (25 kilometers) from its icy surface to interrogate the moon with a sophisticated suite of nine instruments.</p>
<p>Jordan Evans, who leads the team developing Europa Clipper at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, told Ars on Tuesday the mission is on track to depart for Jupiter during a 21-day planetary launch window opening on October 10, 2024.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975039#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975039&comments=1">Comments</a></p>
