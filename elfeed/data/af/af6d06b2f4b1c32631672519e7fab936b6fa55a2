<p>Tesla's unconventional electric pickup is about to go into production, according to company CEO Elon Musk. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/tesla-just-posted-its-q3-financial-results-and-theyre-underwhelming/">As Ars noted yesterday</a>, Tesla's financial results for the third quarter of 2023 included the news that the company plans to begin deliveries of the Cybertruck at the end of November.

Instead of body-on-frame construction like the majority of trucks on our roads, or even a unibody construction like the Honda Ridgeline, the Cybertruck was originally going to feature a monocoque body, similar to a Formula 1 car or prototype, except made of folded stainless steel rather than carbon fiber.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977179#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977179&comments=1">Comments</a></p>
