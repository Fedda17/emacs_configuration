<p>THE DESTROYER! Cover I drew for an insane new comic written by <a href="https://nitter.rawbit.ninja/MaeCatt" title="Mae Catt">@MaeCatt</a> &amp; drawn by Alberto Ponticelli from <a href="https://nitter.rawbit.ninja/badideahello" title="BAD IDEA">@badideahello</a> (pencil, pen, pen, ink wash &amp; white paint on Eon board). I saw an ad for the movie The Stuff in the paper when I was in 1st or 2nd grade, really stuck with me</p>
