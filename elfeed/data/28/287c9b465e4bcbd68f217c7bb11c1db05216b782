<p><strong>Rikao Yanagita:</strong> What was the concept behind the design of the Turn A Gundam?</p>



<p><strong>Syd Mead:</strong> This is a business, and we are in the business of redesigning the Gundam. Just like the &#8220;movie business&#8221; of Hollywood, this is the &#8220;animation business&#8221;. <em>Gundam</em> is a combination of an object and a story. I was honored and lucky to be asked to redesign the Gundam, which has a 20-year tradition and a large fanbase in Japan. It is very important that the audience remembers it forever. If they don&#8217;t like the design, then it can&#8217;t be called a success. Because of this 20-year tradition, it wasn&#8217;t a job that could be done with a lot of freedom. We couldn&#8217;t create it completely freely, and in that sense, there were a lot of restrictions. It had to be in line with the director&#8217;s story. <em>Gundam</em> has lasted for 20 years so far, and from now on&#8230; whether it will last for another 20 or 30 years, I don&#8217;t know&#8230; but I designed a zero-base design for the beginning of a new tradition and history. I approached this work with a &#8220;problem-solving&#8221; approach. Firstly, the design had to be one that fans would remember, and yet still be instantly recognizable as a new Gundam. Secondly, the design had to be simple enough so that the animation company could draw 4,000 animation frames in a week. And lastly, it must be something that can sell as a toy.</p>

Until now, many Gundams have been drawn in this &#8220;looking up from the chest&#8221; composition. </figcaption></figure></div>


<p><strong>Yanagita:</strong> While examining all the details I was able to understand your design philosophy, but what impressed me most was the cylindrical waist. Humans cannot act without upper body twists and turns. However, most conventional robots are a combination of square columns, which makes it impossible for the hips to twist.</p>



<p><strong>Mead:</strong> Sunrise had two requests for the Gundam. One was to make it look glamorous, with a slender waist. The other was to move the position of the cockpit from the upper part of the body to the uterus position. </p>



<p><strong>Yanagita:</strong> I think the position of the uterus implies a &#8220;sense of mental stability&#8221;, but on the other hand it is the part of the robot&#8217;s body that has the least amount of movement.</p>



<p><strong>Mead:</strong> Of course, since this is a robot it doesn&#8217;t have a gender, but at first I couldn&#8217;t understand why they had such an obsession with the word &#8220;uterus&#8221;*.<br>(*The request from Director Tomino was for a simple design and location of the cockpit. In <em>Brain Powerd</em>, the cockpit was positioned around the crotch area, which made the framing easier. The design request was based on these two basic premises.)</p>



<p><strong>Yanagita:</strong> The soles of the Gundam&#8217;s feet are high heels.</p>



<p><strong>Mead:</strong> This is landing gear, which as a similar feeling to a ski boot. In reality, you have to cushion both the descent to the skies and the landing.</p>



<p><strong>Yanagita:</strong> What is with the &#8220;mustache&#8221;?</p>



<p><strong>Mead:</strong> It is part of the helmet and cheek guard, although fans took it as a &#8220;mustache&#8221;. In short, it is an antenna, but when designing it I had to remember that it must be instantly recognizable as a Gundam. The antenna is necessary, but I didn&#8217;t want to put it in the same location as a conventional Gundam, so I chose this position instead. The one on the head is also an antenna. The mustache is in the image of a Japanese kabuto (headpiece), and the head is in the image of a topknot. In the West, it is the helmet of an ancient Roman warrior. The reason I put the mustache here is that, from a design strategy point of view, animation has movement, so it also works as a parallax*. <br>(*originally intended to measure the distance to a celestial body)</p>



<p><strong>Yanagita:</strong> Does that mean that perspective can be expressed by the direction of the mustache?</p>



<p><strong>Mead:</strong> It is easy to put a perspective on the image from above or from the side.</p>

<p class="has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-951dcdacf77bbace822325df64842cc8"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><em>Awkwardly designed human-based robots</em></span></strong></p>



<p><strong>Yanagita:</strong> What do you think of bipedal robots in Japanese anime?</p>



<p><strong>Mead:</strong> For this project, I was asked to design a 20-meter tall robot with two hands and two feet and used a human as a reference. It may sound strange, but that&#8217;s the story. The Gundam is a heroic robot that is like a human being and has a human spirit. In contrast, the enemy characters are monsters, but in my mind they are physically twisted and not in the standard human form. Machines can have one leg or three. It would be nice if the director would write a story in which a one-legged robot appears. But methodologically and stylistically, I think two legs is something that feels natural for humans. In fact, there are myths of giants in every country, so it is natural that robots too have two legs. The dream of creating an automaton, which humans have been pursuing for hundreds of years, is a very ambitious one.</p>



<p><strong>Yanagita:</strong> Is a bipedal robot an effective one when it comes to working or doing a job?</p>



<p><strong>Mead:</strong> We have to solve the balance first. Nature created the human body over tens of thousands of years, and when you think about it, it is the ultimate design. In fact, monkeys&#8217; bodies are also very useful. They can grab things with their tails, and they have a body shape where everything is useful. But when it comes to mobility, I think two legs is the ultimate solution. They can also jump. I am 65 years old now, and after the age of 30 our body shape changes. The belly starts to protrude, and from the spine down we start to look unattractive. So, rather than thinking about robots, it might be better to think about why humans are designed in such an awkward way. At the age of 65, I really wonder why we are made so awkwardly. Given today&#8217;s biotechnology, we may be able to design a new human form within 20 years.</p>



<p><strong>Yanagita:</strong> So do you think when those things become a reality that new stories and new heroes will emerge?</p>



<p><strong>Mead:</strong> Maybe then we&#8217;ll have a hero running around with six or so legs.</p>



<p><strong>Yanagita:</strong> When you said that there was a story first, and from there the &#8220;Gundam&#8221; was born, it was as if you were talking about the birth of the animated robots we have been watching since we were small children.</p>



<p><strong>Mead:</strong> First, there was a story and a dream, and the robot was born from that. Therefore, Gundam is ultimately a friend and admirer of mankind.</p>

<p>Just before the interview, I looked through Mr. Syd Mead&#8217;s art book. Artificial objects were placed with a clear presence in a space that gave the impression of an absorbing expanse. One wonders what kind of words can be uttered from the mouth of the creator of such a world. I was already excited even before the interview began. A large body greeted me, smiling, and with open hands holding a bag of sweets. That was Mr. Mead. I asked him a short question, and the conversation took off from there. Perhaps, whenever there&#8217;s a chance, ideas and images start to flow out of him like a torrent. He wants as many people as possible to have happy dreams. The smallest details of the Gundam are filled with this desire.</p>
