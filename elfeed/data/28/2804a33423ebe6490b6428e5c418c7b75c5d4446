<p>Reuters was <strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/with-tesla-push-india-mulls-import-tax-cut-if-ev-makers-build-locally-2023-08-25/">first to report</a></strong> India is working on a new electric vehicle policy that would slash import taxes for automakers that commit to some local manufacturing, following a proposal by Tesla which is considering entering the domestic market. The policy being considered could allow automakers to import fully-built EVs into India at a reduced tax as low as 15%, compared to the current 100% that applies to many EVs. Shares of potential domestic competitors of Tesla like India&#8217;s Tata Motors fell nearly 3% on the Reuters report, while rival Mahindra and Mahindra dropped over 2%, dragging the benchmark auto index to an intra-day low with losses of 1.1%. </p>
