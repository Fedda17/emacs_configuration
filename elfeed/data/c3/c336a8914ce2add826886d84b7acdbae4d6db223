<p>Today, X (formerly known as Twitter) became the first platform fined under Australia's Online Safety Act. The fine comes after X failed to respond to more than a dozen key questions from Australia eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, who sought clarity on how effectively X detects and mitigates harms of child exploitation and grooming on the platform.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/newsroom/media-releases/second-set-of-tech-giants-falling-short-in-tackling-child-sexual-exploitation-material-sexual-extortion-livestreaming-of-abuse">press release</a>, Inman Grant said that X was given 28 days to appeal the decision or pay the approximately $380,000 fine. While the fine seems small, the reputational ding could further hurt X's chances of persuading advertisers to increase spending on the platform, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/australia-fines-musks-x-platform-386000-over-anti-child-abuse-gaps-2023-10-15/">Reuters suggested</a>. And any failure to comply or respond could trigger even more fines—with X potentially on the hook for as much as $493,402 daily for alleged non-compliance dating back to March 2023, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/16/x-fined-610500-in-australia-first-for-failing-to-crack-down-on-child-sexual-abuse-material">The Guardian reported</a>. That could quickly add up to tens of millions if X misses the Australian regulator's deadline.</p>
<p>“If they choose not to pay, it’s open to eSafety to take other action or to seek a civil penalty through the courts,” Inman Grant <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/heinous-crimes-twitter-fined-600-000-over-child-safety-failures-20231015-p5ecda.html">told the Sydney Morning Herald</a>. “We’re talking about some of the most heinous crimes playing out on these platforms, committed against innocent children.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976283#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976283&comments=1">Comments</a></p>
