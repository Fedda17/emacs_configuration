<p>As far as I can tell, there's no universally accepted "cure" for tinnitus, but there are a number of "therapies" out there, some of which seem to prey upon people looking for relief but some of which seem plausible.<p>I'm wondering if any subscribers here have had tinnitus and experience <i>permanent relief</i> from the ringing? Not just reduction, but actual permanent relief that never comes back even when doing things that previously worsened the tinnitus.<p>If you can't tell, I'm trying to establish an "existence proof" here, if no one has ever gotten permanent relief then it seems like it might not be worth bothering with the "symptom reduction" therapies since they would most likely lead to focusing on the symptoms more intensely.</p>
