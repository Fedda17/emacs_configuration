<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Gonna keep this brief, but <a href="/r/UpliftingNews">/r/UpliftingNews</a> is meant to uplift others in an attempt to bridge cultural differences for the greater good of humanity. That&#39;s it. </p> <p>This is no dig on anybody else, and any other prerogative is respected, but the mission statement here is clear, as are the rules.. which is only 1 rule if you want to get technical: <strong>Don&#39;t Be A Dick.</strong> </p> <p>Just appreciate humanity where you can, because we are all statistically impossible and should celebrate that instead of wasting time arguing about silly nonsense... but now I&#39;m venting and risking violating our clearly defined only rule here. </p> <p>So please be good to your fellow living creatures out there, make note to recognize them, and as long as you do that with sincerity, you have no excuse. Thanks for reading this far and be good to yourself over others. It takes a village for sure.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/razorsheldon"> /u/razorsheldon </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/14apm8h/update_6152023/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/14apm8h/update_6152023/">[comments]</a></span>
