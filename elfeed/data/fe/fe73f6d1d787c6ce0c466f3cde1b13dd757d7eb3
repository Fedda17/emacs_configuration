<p>Most of Apple's big product announcements for the year were made in September, but the company may still have some surprises up its sleeve. Last week, it announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/apple-introduces-a-new-pencil-for-the-ipad-its-cheapest-yet/">an oddball USB-C Apple Pencil</a>, and Bloomberg's usually well-informed Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p">says</a> that a new Apple Silicon iMac refresh could arrive as soon as next week.</p>
<p>The iMac was last updated in the summer of 2021, well over two years ago, when Apple replaced the 21.5-inch Intel model with a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/24-inch-imac-review-theres-still-no-step-three/">redesigned M1-powered Apple Silicon model</a>. Aside from the M1 MacBook Air, which Apple continues to sell as its entry-level notebook, it's the only kind of Mac that hasn't gotten some kind of M2 chip.</p>
<p>Gurman doesn't mention them, but an updated iMac could also give Apple the opportunity to refresh its Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad accessories with a USB-C port to match the new iPhone 15 series and the USB-C version of the AirPods. Right now, these accessories, the older iPhones Apple still sells, the Apple TV's Siri Remote, and the low-end iPad are all still using the Lightning port.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977754#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977754&comments=1">Comments</a></p>
