<p>More automakers this week announced a switch in the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/the-ars-technica-guide-to-electric-vehicle-charging/">style of charging plugs</a> that will be fitted to their future electric vehicles. On Wednesday BMW broke its news, then yesterday Toyota did the same: Both are ditching the Combined Charging Standard 1 socket for their North American EVs and will instead use the North American Charging System plug, designed by Tesla. Together with the changing plug comes access for their EV drivers to Tesla's Supercharger network.</p>
<h2>BMW</h2>
<p>BMW's announcement applies to all its car brands, which means that in addition to EVs like the BMW <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/bmw-has-an-all-new-electric-5-series-and-weve-driven-it-the-2024-bmw-i5/">i5</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/testing-bmws-biggest-and-best-sedan-now-fully-electric-the-2023-i7/">i7</a>, it's also swapping over to NACS for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/2025-mini-cooper-and-countryman-evs-bring-more-range-style/">upcoming Mini EVs</a> as well as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/07/silent-smooth-sublime-driving-the-electric-2024-rolls-royce-spectre/">the Rolls-Royce Spectre</a>. BMW will start adding native NACS ports to its EVs in 2025, and that same year its customers will gain access to the Tesla Supercharger network.</p>
<p>BMW's release doesn't explicitly mention a CCS1-NACS adapter being made available, but it does say that BMW (and Mini and Rolls-Royce) EVs with CCS1 ports will be able to use Superchargers from early 2025.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977438#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977438&comments=1">Comments</a></p>
