I split my time on this trip between urban environs and the countryside to better-understand, if not fully decipher, what&#8217;s going on.

Older people remember <a href="https://manifold.bfi.uchicago.edu/read/case-of-argentina/section/9905ef24-8c94-42ad-adf7-068efb4d9afb">the loss of credibility in the 1970s, leading to late-1980s debates over dollarization</a> (full dollarization never happened, but the idea significantly influenced Domingo Cavallo and others). People my age remember the Clinton-era peg to the dollar (the &#8220;Convertibility&#8221; plan of early 1991), created under Carlos Menem, shattering. Young people speak of friends who tried to store money in Terra&#8217;s algorithmic stablecoin ecosystem (oh don&#8217;t worry, <a href="https://decrypt.co/155775/flatcoins-new-thing-on-the-horizon-coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong">there&#8217;s more &#8220;innovation&#8221; in this area coming soon</a>&#8230;).</p><p>The problem with pegs is <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20065441">they&#8217;re hard to manage and they don&#8217;t break gently</a>; it isn&#8217;t a wall crumbling (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-24/lebanon-s-dollar-peg-gives-way-to-currency-chaos-after-default">a favorite analogy of finance academics and broadsheet journalists</a>), it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveschaefer/2015/07/07/forbes-flashback-george-soros-british-pound-euro-ecb/">a wall failing when tested by enemy artillery</a> (the artillery is typically fired from a trading desk in London or New York or Singapore). There is only so much one can do to defend; relaxing (<em><a href="https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-is-not-greece-it-is-a-latin-america-style-soft-peg-bellwether-12626/">quasi-peg</a></em> or &#8220;soft peg&#8221;) parity while raising short-term interest rates is the classic move, but this inevitably creates &#8220;credit crunch&#8221; dynamics and disadvantages capital-intensive domestic ventures.

And, to be fair, Bitcoin has been a decent store of value for Argentines compared to pesos and even compared to other weaker currencies; attractively, it can be bought and sold 24 hours a day and can be converted and withdrawn in pesos or USD at convenience stores.</p><p>Unlike USD-ARS, a parity the government closely monitors, manages, and distributes disinformation around, pairs like BTC-ARS or ETH-ARS are not subject to local rate-setting interventions. I was able to withdraw (as a test) 0.05 ETH (worth 81.25 USD on 17 September) and receive 56,000 pesos, which implies a parity among the three at 690 pesos per U.S. dollar <em>net of fees</em>.

Aerolineas is also vital to international business travel in the region, connecting businesspeople and services in Brazil, Chile, Peru, and elsewhere with 21 cities within Argentina with just one connection (38 domestic cities reachable with two connections). And to Aerolineas&#8217;s credit, <a href="https://www.aviacionline.com/2023/08/aerolineas-argentinas-loss-reduced-by-61-in-1h23/">the pecuniary bleeding is clotting, if not stopping</a>.</p><p>Yes, <a href="https://www.oxfordeconomics.com/resource/the-economic-impact-of-aerolineas-argentinas/">many academic analysts</a> and financial journalists would love to see something happen with Aerolineas that is comparable to the comparative success story of Avianca, Colombia&#8217;s flag carrier which I&#8217;ve flown many times and which (through loan repayments and payment of various taxes) is often cited as an industrial policy win for Colombia, without a huge impact on Colombia&#8217;s national budget and with shares in Avianca listed and good volumes trading.&nbsp;</p><p>This overlooks, however, that Avianca&#8217;s much-heralded survival of COVID (and its post-COVID solvency) depended upon piling accumulated obligations into a May 10, 2020 bankruptcy in the Southern District of New York (I&#8217;ve told both economics and law students for years that airlines receive an often-underappreciated subsidy via the preferential treatment they expect and usually get in the U.S. bankruptcy courts; US Airways, United, Northwest, and Delta all filed for bankruptcy protection between 2002 and 2005, with management of all four airlines receiving kudos for the maneuver). And 2020 wasn&#8217;t the only time in recent memory Avianca resorted to this (<em>see</em> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?scidkt=12778617621079281456+9443182676928815811&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;hl=en">345 B.R. 120 (BK. S.D.N.Y. 2006) (Gropper, J.)</a>) and its strong post-bankruptcy posture includes proceeds from quietly liquidating its Peruvian subsidiary.</p><p>Further, Avianca is <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avianca">the oldest airline in the Western Hemisphere</a> and created the air cargo industry&#8217;s very first product offering. None of these historical advantages or tactical maneuvers were available to Aerolineas, as it has no access to foreign bankruptcy courts accustomed to giving enormous preference to airlines over creditors and has no legal authority to engage in the kinds of strategic divestments from which Avianca benefited. To compare these two carriers is not just unfair, it&#8217;s unhelpful.</p><p>Though it&#8217;s an area of interest and enthusiasm for me, let&#8217;s now rotate away from airlines.</p><p>The day after I arrived in Argentina, on 7 September, <em>The Economist</em> <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/09/07/argentina-needs-to-default-not-dollarise">ran a provocative piece</a> entitled &#8220;<em>Argentina Needs to Default, Not Dollarise</em>.&#8221; I&#8217;ve spent time (half a dozen non-contiguous weeks, admittedly not months) in Haiti and <a href="https://devinit.org/resources/chinese-lending-to-east-africa-what-the-numbers-tell-us/">nearly three years living in some of the poorest countries in Africa</a>. I&#8217;ve seen default debates up-close. They aren&#8217;t trivial, aren&#8217;t pretty, and often aren&#8217;t non-violent.</p><p>There is an American (and more recently, British) feeling that default is akin to bankruptcy, an unfortunate consequence of missteps in matters fiscal, a mostly-destigmatized procedural baptism.</p><p>But that&#8217;s not how defaults work.

And that was an orderly bankruptcy, a scenario where most got to retire with unstained careers. Today&#8217;s reality is 13:00 tee times, second homes, and third wives; going down with the ship is for suckers.</p><p>And that was one of the bigger small-enough-to-fail banks.</p><p>But that isn&#8217;t what sovereign default is like, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-debt-banking-loans-financial-developing-countries-collapse-8df6f9fac3e1e758d0e6d8d5dfbd3ed6">as Sri Lanka and Zambia recently learned</a>.</p><p>I&#8217;ve spoken and written extensively on the topic of borrowing and defaults in the context of development economics and, in particular, relative to credit-challenged countries that use Chinese development credit facilities as lenders of last resort.

href="https://coinatmradar.com/city/34/bitcoin-atm-buenos-aires/">that motto mentioned </a><em><a href="https://coinatmradar.com/city/34/bitcoin-atm-buenos-aires/">supra</a></em><a href="https://coinatmradar.com/city/34/bitcoin-atm-buenos-aires/"> at a bodega&#8217;s Bitcoin ATM in Buenos Aires</a>: <em>cualquier cosa es major que pesos</em> (&#8220;Anything is better than pesos.&#8221;). <em>The Economist</em> quotes Melei, accurately, as having said the Argentine central bank&#8217;s performance managing the peso has been &#8220;the worst thing in the universe&#8221; (or &#8220;the worst garbage that exists on earth&#8221; <a href="https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/economy/argentinas-javier-milei-vows-to-pay-countrys-debt-while-shuttering-the-central-bank.phtml">if you prefer this translation</a>). Nobody can argue with the statistics; annual inflation today is over 100% and Ecuador&#8217;s experience with dollarization two decades ago (despite similar gloomy predictions from the press) was one of stabilization and calm&#8230; but this doesn&#8217;t provide a foolproof recipe for Argentina&#8217;s fiscal salvation.</p><p>Unlike some other recent political darlings, Milei talks rarely about <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25675779">Argentina&#8217;s golden age</a> or the miraculous GDP growth <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/778193e4-44d8-11de-82d6-00144feabdc0">from 1870-ish until the First World War</a>. At that time, economic historians recite like a line from their favorite movie, <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/LAER%20Introduction%20to%20Argentine%20Exceptionalism_3c49e7ee-4f31-49a0-ba21-6e2b726cd7c5.pdf">Argentina was wealthier than France and Italy combined and even wealthier than mighty Germany</a>. But, today, those peddling nostalgia find few customers.</p><p>Instead, Milei speaks in metaphors of crisis, disease, and war, which suggests to me that he&#8217;s on the right page: the crisis is real, imminent, and serious. And it is the right rhetoric for the moment; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Club">the Paris Club</a> and other creditor cartels won&#8217;t step up to finance an Argentina led by a person who uses any less urgent language.</p><p>The press, however, is right to point out that changing currencies will not by itself constrain Argentina&#8217;s legendary spendthrift tendencies (the nation has been running a fiscal deficit for thirteen years and the money printer is still going &#8220;<em>brrrrrr!</em>&#8221;). Argentina has had, on average, <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Countries/ARG">an IMF bailout every three years since the U.S. Eisenhower administration</a>&#8211;and currently owes the IMF about $45B. And the press, including the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/acca94f3-6bad-4832-94fc-563865d4e241">FT</a> and the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/argentina-binges-on-the-world-cup-to-forget-soaring-inflation-and-unrest-11670510149">WSJ</a>, have correctly done the basic arithmetic that the small changes politicians (including <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/parts-of-latin-america-will-shift-to-the-right-in-2023">Milei</a>) discuss in public will not substantially reduce public spending, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/imfs-argentina-predicament-seek-reforms-tango-or-kill-music-2023-09-15/">let alone repay</a> the IMF or Chinese creditors. For perspective, Argentina&#8217;s debt represents about a quarter of all outstanding IMF loan principal and the IMF loan must be repaid in hard currency, the one thing soybean-rich, lithium-rich, tradition-rich, malbec-rich, tango-rich Argentina doesn&#8217;t have easily to hand.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9dbc3dd-5ed3-4947-9b1a-9d970fa8daef_1600x985.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9dbc3dd-5ed3-4947-9b1a-9d970fa8daef_1600x985.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9dbc3dd-5ed3-4947-9b1a-9d970fa8daef_1600x985.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9dbc3dd-5ed3-4947-9b1a-9d970fa8daef_1600x985.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9dbc3dd-5ed3-4947-9b1a-9d970fa8daef_1600x985.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9dbc3dd-5ed3-4947-9b1a-9d970fa8daef_1600x985.png" width="1456" height="896" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b9dbc3dd-5ed3-4947-9b1a-9d970fa8daef_1600x985.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:896,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;A row of books on a shelf\n\nDescription automatically generated&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="A row of books on a shelf

Let&#8217;s pause and remember our brains are <em>awesome</em> at seeing patterns where they don&#8217;t exist, and <em>even better</em> at imagining (or <em>failing to see</em>) causation.</p><p>We discard what seems unlikely according to our cultural priors (like that the terms <em>laissez-faire</em> and <em>ketchup</em> originated in China) and are too willing to accept arbitrary cyclical explanations, for example the <em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/no/podcast/the-long-term-impact-of-covid-ft-karl-muth/id1390384827?i=1000489215772">Muth Conflict-Cuisine Hypothesis</a></em> (my joke theory that 30 years after the U.S. ceases hostilities in a country, that place&#8217;s food becomes trendy in California, evidenced by sushi/yakitori/ramen in the 70s, Korean BBQ places in 80s, the boom in Vietnamese food&#8217;s popularity in the 2000s, etc.&#8211;I eagerly await the <s>fore</s>fauxcasted wave of good Afghan restaurants in the early 2050s&#8230;).</p><p>Though recent history (a 2014 default, the 2017 <em>caracolear</em> which was a miscue recovery; <em>caracolear</em> is a &#8220;fake out&#8221; soccer maneuver, a 2020 default, and the current 2023 crisis) does make a three-year cadence an attractive theory of Argentine crisis, Milei and others correctly point out that the causes of these events are distinguishable and that while some crises are connected (the 2017 mirage of economic recovery, a brief 2.5% economic expansion followed by a 2.5+% contraction and a fresh peso crisis, led to an impasse that arguably teed up the 2020 default), they do not point to some grand <em>horologie-de-crise</em>.</p><p>And, frankly, if Argentina had a crisis every three years, it would be the only thing vaguely punctual or predictable in the whole economy&#8230; which invites the question: if each crisis is a cumulation of unique and disorderly things, how would these disorderly things coalesce into a predictable rhythm (and, no, this isn&#8217;t entropy)? In short, the three-year crisis rhythm might make for a good &#8220;hot takes&#8221; news item, but it&#8217;s total economic nonsense.</p><p>Though I stop short of endorsing his thinking, I appreciate and share Milei&#8217;s sense of urgency, even if it is not reflected in the caf&#233; culture and slow pace on the sidewalks of Buenos Aires.

Even without this sector-level distortion, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304393212000967">the Argentine government has not been particularly consistent</a>, and at times has been downright misleading (oh, sorry, <em>strategic</em>), about what it chooses to include in the pricing basket from which the official inflation rate is computed.</p><p>And even when the basket is consistent, its measured <em>locus</em> is occasionally magically transported hundreds or thousands of miles.</p><p>Less-politicized bimonthly CPI numbers are available (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/06/business/inflation-argentina.html">and often used by international media</a>) and, basket-to-basket, year-on-year, it looks like this (<em>below</em>), though the government and international organizations (including the IMF) have had disagreements as to how inflation should be measured in 2023 and January of 2023 is the most recent year of (at least tentative) unanimity on this topic.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13d2f3f1-1062-404a-8634-75d179d21ba7_1600x1099.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13d2f3f1-1062-404a-8634-75d179d21ba7_1600x1099.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13d2f3f1-1062-404a-8634-75d179d21ba7_1600x1099.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13d2f3f1-1062-404a-8634-75d179d21ba7_1600x1099.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13d2f3f1-1062-404a-8634-75d179d21ba7_1600x1099.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13d2f3f1-1062-404a-8634-75d179d21ba7_1600x1099.png" width="1456" height="1000" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/13d2f3f1-1062-404a-8634-75d179d21ba7_1600x1099.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1000,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13d2f3f1-1062-404a-8634-75d179d21ba7_1600x1099.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13d2f3f1-1062-404a-8634-75d179d21ba7_1600x1099.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13d2f3f1-1062-404a-8634-75d179d21ba7_1600x1099.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13d2f3f1-1062-404a-8634-75d179d21ba7_1600x1099.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Source: Statista</figcaption></figure></div><p>Ignoring the hailstorm of proposed numbers from the Argentine government, presidential candidates, and international groups, let&#8217;s stick with &#8220;things are bad&#8221; as the null hypothesis.</p><p>When I see data I don&#8217;t trust, <a href="https://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/06/10/2014/six-four-end-automotive-apartheid">or something confusing, or history I don&#8217;t understand, I look to an industry I know well for answers: automotive</a>.</p><p>What assumptions are integrated in savvy multinationals&#8217; calculations?</p><p>Though dealers are reluctant to quote full-term, all-in amounts in pesos, we can look carefully at published leasing rates with stated, broken-out residuals, which Citroen, Fiat, Renault, and Volkswagen publish for Argentina, and using equivalent rates with similar residuals for Peru and Colombia, I see these leases integrating at least an anticipated 160% peso-native (nominal) inflation rate across a three-year lease, with the French (Citroen and Renault) being the most pessimistic and integrating a 200% inflation rate, which shows up both in payments and peso-denominated depreciation. Isolating depreciation by using the residuals from nearby markets, the anticipated inflation is 160-215%.</p><p>I should mention that Renault aren&#8217;t dummies who know their way around wrenches but not economics; in fact, well-regarded industrial and institutional economists in France are very involved historically and in the recent period in setting the rates, FX coefficients, and default expectations on which Renault&#8217;s financial products rely. Similarly, Fiat&#8217;s parent, a Dutch holding company, Stellantis, is risk-averse and resells a hefty chunk of its leasing- and lending-related liabilities, so it has no incentive to subsidize Argentine leases (as non-market lease terms would then encumber the securities that are aggregated and resold). The inflation numbers implicitly predicted by these firms are not unimaginable.</p><p>In short, folks (dealerships for inventory and customers as well) are buying (and leasing) cars, but aren&#8217;t buying the government&#8217;s stable peso story&#8230; perhaps with one conspicuous exception, the International and Commercial Bank of China, <a href="https://www.icbc.com.ar/personas/productos-servicios/prestamos/leasing">which will happily write you a full-term, zero-down third-party lease in pesos</a>. Bring-your-own financing is somewhat rare in Latin America (I consulted on the construction of a local credit facility for an international bank writing leases and loans in Brazil many years ago) and offers of third-party leasing are somewhat unusual also; both will soon be Chinese imports here.</p><h4><strong>Wrap-Up</strong></h4><p>In Ushuaia, the capital city of Tierra del Fuego (<em>Ant&#225;rtida e Islas del Atl&#225;ntico Sur</em> Province), hard currency flows to a degree rare in rural Argentina, which makes it a great place to gather one&#8217;s thoughts about the trip and the financial estuaries within Argentina where dollars and pesos mix. Here, a nice late model Toyota Landcruiser was offered for sale on the roadside with no price listed, but &#8220;dollars only&#8221; written on the windshield; clearly, while price was up for negotiation, currency involved was not.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd445ea06-778b-438c-b59a-388ee6379a60_1600x902.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd445ea06-778b-438c-b59a-388ee6379a60_1600x902.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd445ea06-778b-438c-b59a-388ee6379a60_1600x902.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd445ea06-778b-438c-b59a-388ee6379a60_1600x902.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd445ea06-778b-438c-b59a-388ee6379a60_1600x902.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd445ea06-778b-438c-b59a-388ee6379a60_1600x902.jpeg" width="1456" height="821" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d445ea06-778b-438c-b59a-388ee6379a60_1600x902.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:821,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;A person holding a sign\n\nDescription automatically generated&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="A person holding a sign

First of all, there is an unimaginably-large backstop of dollars the country would need to hold and resist spending, which feels like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment">a country-level Stanford marshmallow experiment</a> any administration in recent memory would have failed. Second, the unit of account is not the problem, as no matter how the spending is tallied, it outruns and dwarfs the fundamentals of the Argentine economy. Third, the loss of control over core central bank functions may seem like a needed straitjacket for policymakers, but long-term it means domestic monetary policymaking capacity may erode even further.</p><p>The lack of clarity about government monetary policy moving forward, the lack of constraints imposed by the IMF, the temptation of taking recourse loans from the Chinese, and the institutional inability to implement binding capital controls combine in Argentina for an exciting election cycle, a strange on-the-ground experience, and an uncertain future.</p><p>But you should consider visiting and drawing your own conclusions. As the white and pink prematurely-blooming trees encircling Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires indicate, time marches on&#8230; and it&#8217;s going to be a hot summer, literally, politically, and economically, kicking off with the 22 October presidential election.</p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/argentinas-macroeconomic-situation?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/argentinas-macroeconomic-situation?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p>
