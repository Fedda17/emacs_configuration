<p>Caroline Ellison, the former Alameda Research CEO who dated Sam Bankman-Fried, testified against her former partner today in his criminal trial. "In the trial's second week, Ellison said she committed fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering along with Bankman-Fried and others," the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/bankman-fried-trial-caroline-ellison-ftx-sbf-bdab0230730ec079fad8e2086cf9b3f6">Associated Press reported</a>.</p>
<p>"He was originally the CEO of Alameda and the owner of Alameda and he directed me to commit these crimes," Ellison said today, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-10/caroline-ellison-appears-in-court-ahead-of-testimony-in-sbf-case">Bloomberg article</a>. She added that "Alameda took several billion dollars from FTX customers and used it for its own investments" and to pay oﬀ lenders.</p>
<p>Ellison's testimony began shortly before the court took a break for a lunch. The trial is in US District Court for the Southern District of New York, located in Manhattan.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1974981#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1974981&comments=1">Comments</a></p>
