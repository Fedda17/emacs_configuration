<span id="more-9990"></span>



<p><strong>WORKING WITH THE SUNRISE STAFF</strong></p>



<p>My first encounter with the talented Sunrise staff was in Tokyo on July 30, 1998.</p>



<p>An incredible woman by the name of Mieko Ishikawa was working with me then. She was my bridge for understanding Japanese culture and conducting business negotiations. We walked from the Akasaka hotel where I was staying at to the Sunrise Studio 1 office in the Suginami Ward. Despite the dreary weather and occasional rain, the Sunrise meeting room was brimming with a golden glow of creativity. We introduced ourselves to each other.</p>



<p>I exchanged ideas with Mr. Yoshiyuki Tomino, the creator and general director of <em>Turn A Gundam</em>, along with the rest of his staff of young men and women. With the help of Ms. Ishikawa&#8217;s interpretations, we all learned a valuable lesson that day about working together to create something valuable. In less than four hours, the creators, designers, animators, model makers, and technicians had come together as a unit and gave birth to a novel anime series.</p>



<p>I still recall this moment fondly, as I was struck by how easy it is to communicate ideas when it comes to the arts, especially when both sides of the table are intelligent, passionate, talented, and willing to stay up late at night in order to create something worthwhile. A group of people who even have the desire to try and do things that may seem impossible.</p>



<p>It takes courage to face new trials and give new direction to old traditions. Now, allow me to list the names of the people I&#8217;ll never stop praising.</p>



<p><strong>Mr. Yoshiyuki Tomino</strong>, the well-known director of <em>Turn A Gundam</em>; <strong>Mr. Shigeru Horiguchi</strong>, the mechanical design producer; <strong>Mr. Atsushi Shigeta</strong>, the mechanical design coordinator, who was responsible for taking my sketches and pen scribbles and turning them into master drawings for advertising purposes.</p>



<p><strong>Mr. Shigeru Morita</strong> (Studio Nue), who is famous for his many contributions to anime history; <strong>Mr. Katsuo Kawaguchi</strong>, a 3D modeler who could easily transform 2D images into three-dimensional objects.</p>



<p><strong>Ms. Tetsuko Takahashi</strong>, who had no limits—she tirelessly arranged my visit to Sunrise and organized all the saved records from previous draft meetings for me to review; <strong>Ms. Rie Akutsu</strong>, who shined as Mr. Horiguchi&#8217;s assistant; <strong>Ms. Kaoru Asai</strong>, who managed scheduling and publicity. And of course, the many animators, designers, and artists who made <em>Turn A Gundam</em> a success.</p>



<p>Finally, I&#8217;d like to mention a few people who weren&#8217;t directly involved in <em>Turn A Gundam</em>&#8216;s production, but who have made great contributions to the franchise and allowed me to join their ranks with new creations.</p>



<p><strong>Mr. Takayuki Yoshii</strong>, the president of Sunrise, who gave me a warm welcome on my visit to Tokyo; <strong>Mr. Masuo Ueda</strong>, production manager of the <em>Gundam</em> division, who patiently worked with us; <strong>Mr. Katsushi Murakami</strong>, the president of MegaHouse Corporation, who opened my eyes to the bewilderingly long tradition of robot characters in anime; <strong>Mr. Kouichi Inoue</strong> (<em>G-Saviour</em>&#8216;s producer), who became my <em>Gundam</em> mentor and provided constructive feedback to help me better understand the franchise.</p>



<p>I would also like to pay special tribute to <strong>Mr. Akira Yasuda</strong> (Capcom) from Osaka as someone who was essential to the success of the series. He designed <em>Turn A Gundam</em>&#8216;s characters.</p>



<p>My experiences with the <em>Gundam</em> mobile suits would not be complete without the existence of <strong>Mr. Kunio Okawara</strong>. He has overseen the development of <em>Gundam</em> mobile suits for over twenty years. This talented designer has a precise understanding of form and detailing, and he is also committed to creating compelling designs that fit the storytelling requirements. I want to thank and acknowledge him for his contributions to the <em>Gundam</em> franchise. It is because of his work that I was able to create the robot designs for <em>Turn A Gundam.</em></p>



<p>I admire the works and talents of all the people I have listed, and I hope that <em>Turn A Gundam</em> will be a new benchmark for the anime art industry to follow.</p>

<p><strong>COMMENTS IN 2013: GETTING INVOLVED WITH <em>TURN A GUNDAM</em></strong></p>



<p>When I was contacted about working on a new <em>Gundam</em> project, I flew to Japan to meet with Mr. Tomino and other Sunrise &amp; Bandai staff. I dined with Mr. Tomino, his wife, and one of their daughters at a private restaurant in Izu and enjoyed a Kaiseki-ryōri meal. I gained insight on the story and mobile suit ideas he had for his new project.</p>



<p>I later met with a designer who had been designing mobile suits for the past twenty years. My job was to create a &#8220;zero base&#8221; Gundam mobile suit that would both be new and still completely recognizable to the harsh Japanese and international anime fans. It was a great honor to be asked to redesign the robots of one of the most famous franchises in the world of anime. With the help of Mr. Inoue and the talented staff at Sunrise &amp; Bandai, I was able to successfully complete the designs of seven mobile suits.</p>



<p>Mr. Horiguchi from Sunrise was my design contact at the Japanese studio. The series aired and received very high reviews. My involvement with the Sunrise &amp; Bandai team was an incredibly enjoyable time in my life. As a professional, I was constantly excited and put on edge. I&#8217;m happy that since then my presence and relevancy in the Japanese community has increased.</p>
