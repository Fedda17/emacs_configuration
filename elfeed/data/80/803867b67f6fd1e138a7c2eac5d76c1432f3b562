<p>I've got an iPhone X. It's not the latest and greatest, but still runs fine and does basically everything I need it to do.<p>However, it seems like any time I need to visit an actual web site from my phone, the entire experience is just terrible. Nearly every web site fills the screen with resource-intensive ads, enormous newsletter sign up dialogs with tiny close buttons, and of course, the obligatory cookie notice.<p>I don't want to have an app for every single business I visit or service I subscribe to, but I also do what I can to avoid visiting their horrid web pages.<p>How do you tackle this? Or am I just making a big deal over nothing?</p>
