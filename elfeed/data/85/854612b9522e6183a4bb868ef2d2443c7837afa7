<p>SpaceX is disputing a Federal Aviation Administration report to Congress on the risk of Starlink satellite debris falling to Earth, alleging that the FAA "relied in error on a deeply ﬂawed analysis that falsely characterizes reentry disposal risks associated with Starlink." The analysis used by the FAA "reflects nothing more than the culmination of several egregious errors, omissions, and incorrect assumptions—and it should be dismissed," SpaceX said.</p>
<p>The FAA's <a href="https://www.faa.gov/about/plansreports/congress/risk-associated-reentry-disposal-satellites-proposed-large">report to Congress</a> on the "risk associated with reentry disposal of satellites from proposed large constellations in low Earth orbit" was made public on Thursday last week.
