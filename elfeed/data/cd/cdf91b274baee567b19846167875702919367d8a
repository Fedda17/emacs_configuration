<p>On Thursday, Google <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/protecting-customers-with-generative-ai-indemnification">announced</a> that it plans to defend users of its generative AI systems on Google Cloud and Workspace platforms against intellectual property violation claims, reports <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-defend-generative-ai-users-copyright-claims-2023-10-12/">Reuters</a>. The move follows similar commitments by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/microsoft-offers-legal-protection-for-ai-copyright-infringement-challenges/">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90906560/adobe-feels-so-confident-its-firefly-generative-ai-wont-breach-copyright-itll-cover-your-legal-bills">Adobe</a>, but Google claims its approach is more comprehensive, covering both the use of copyrighted works for training AI and the output generated by the systems.</p>

<p>"<span class="dQQu7c" data-track-type="">The generated output indemnity means that you can use content generated with a range of our products knowing Google will indemnify you for third-party IP claims, including copyright," Google writes in its announcement post.</span></p>
<p>Specifically, the new policy will cover software like its <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai">Vertex AI</a> development platform and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/googles-30-per-month-duet-ai-will-craft-awkward-emails-images-for-you/">Duet AI</a> system, which are used for generating text and images in Google Workspace and Cloud programs. Notably, the Google announcement did not mention <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/google-says-its-bard-generative-chat-ai-is-out-launches-waitlist/">Bard</a>, Google's more well-known generative AI chatbot.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975919#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975919&comments=1">Comments</a></p>
