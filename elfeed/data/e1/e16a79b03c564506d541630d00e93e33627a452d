<p>Lenovo's Motorola mobile brand is resurfacing the idea of the bendable, bracelet-like smartphone. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jvAZvRek-sQ?feature=shared&amp;t=6694">Demoed</a> at Lenovo Tech World '23 in Austin, Texas, yesterday, Motorola's "adaptive display" revisits a concept that we've seen discussed for years but that doesn't seem any closer to actually being sold.</p>
<p>On stage at the event, Lexi Valasek, 312 Labs innovation strategy and product research Lead for Motorola Mobility, proudly held a prototype. The smartphone looked ordinary to start: a slab of OLED with a chassis that's a bold orange on the backside. But Valasek quickly bent the phone into an arch shape, where it stood on her hand before she wrapped it around her wrist like a cuff.</p>
<p>The phone seemed to adapt to its new positioning rapidly, quickly showing a large clock, making the device feel like a smartwatch.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978561#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978561&comments=1">Comments</a></p>
