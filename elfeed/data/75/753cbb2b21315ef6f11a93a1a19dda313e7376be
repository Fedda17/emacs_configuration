<p>Earlier this week, SpaceX launched for the 75th time this year, continuing a flight cadence that should see the company come close to 100 missions by the end of December.</p>
<p>SpaceX plans to kick its launch rate into a higher gear in 2024. This will be largely driven by launches of upgraded Starlink satellites with the ability to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/spacex-details-starlink-for-phones-plan-launching-in-2024/">connect directly with consumer cell phones</a>, a service SpaceX calls "Starlink Direct to Cell," a company official told Ars this week.</p>
<p>The goal next year is 12 launches per month, for a total of 144 Falcon rocket flights. Like this year, most of those missions will be primarily devoted to launching Starlink broadband satellites.
