<p>Google has agreed to stop advertising YouTube TV as "$600 less than cable" after losing an appeal of a previous ruling that went against the company. Google said it will "modify or cease the disputed advertising claim."</p>
<p>The case was handled in the advertising industry's self-regulatory system, not in a court of law. The National Advertising Review Board (NARB) <a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media-center/dd/narb-google-youtube-tv">announced today</a> that it rejected Google's appeal and recommended that the company discontinue the YouTube TV claim.</p>
<p>YouTube TV launched in 2017 for $35 a month, but the base package is $72.99 after the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/youtube-tv-jumps-in-price-again-its-now-72-99-per-month/">latest price hike</a> in March 2023. Google's "$600 less than cable" claim was challenged by Charter, which uses the brand name Spectrum and is the second-biggest cable company after Comcast. The National Advertising Division (NAD) previously ruled in Charter's favor but Google <a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media-center/dd/google-youtube-tv">appealed the decision</a> to the NARB in August.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975403#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975403&comments=1">Comments</a></p>
