<p>This month, more than three dozen victims allegedly terrorized by stalkers using Apple AirTags have joined a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/12/apple-airtags-are-now-the-weapon-of-choice-for-stalkers-lawsuit-says/">class-action lawsuit filed in a California court last December against Apple</a>. They alleged in an <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hughes-v-Apple-Amended-Complaint-10-12-2023.pdf">amended complaint</a> that, partly due to Apple's negligence, AirTags have become "one of the most dangerous and frightening technologies employed by stalkers" because they can be easily, cheaply, and covertly used to determine "real-time location information to track victims."</p>
<p>Since the lawsuit was initially filed in 2022, plaintiffs have alleged that there has been an "explosion of reporting" showing that AirTags are frequently being used for stalking, including a spike in international AirTags stalking cases and more than 150 police reports in the US as of April 2022. More recently, there were 19 AirTags stalking cases in one US metropolitan area—Tulsa, Oklahoma—alone, the complaint said.</p>
<p>This seeming escalation is concerning, plaintiffs say, because Apple allegedly has not done enough to mitigate harms, and AirTags stalking can lead to financial ruin, as victims bear significant costs like hiring mechanics to strip their cars to locate AirTags or repeatedly relocating their homes. AirTags stalking can also end in violence, including murder, plaintiffs alleged, and the problem is likely bigger than anyone knows, because stalking is historically underreported.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975778#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975778&comments=1">Comments</a></p>
