<p>Nearly a decade ago, the European Space Agency announced plans to develop the next generation of its Ariane rocket, the Ariane 6 booster. The goal was to bring a less costly workhorse rocket to market that could compete with the likes of SpaceX's Falcon 9 booster and begin flying by 2020.</p>
<p>It has been well documented that development of the Ariane 6 is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/09/no-firm-date-on-ariane-6s-debut-and-no-public-talk-on-prices-either/">running years behind</a>—the vehicle is now unlikely to fly before the middle of 2024 and subject to further delays. For example, a critical long-duration hot fire of the vehicle's Vulcain 2.1 main engine had been scheduled for "early October," but there have been no recent updates on when this key test will occur.</p>
<p>However, there are also increasing concerns that the Ariane 6 rocket will not meet its ambitious price targets. For years, European officials have said they would like to cut the price of launches by half with a rocket that is easier to manufacture and by flying an increased cadence of missions.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975565#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975565&comments=1">Comments</a></p>
