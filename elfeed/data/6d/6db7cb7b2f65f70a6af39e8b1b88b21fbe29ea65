<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><em>Turn A Gundam</em> Production Press Conference Full Report</span></strong></p>



<p>On February 16th, a press conference was held at a hotel in Tokyo to announce the production of <em>Turn A Gundam</em>. The press conference, which was attended by Yoshiyuki Tomino and related parties, was brimming with enthusiasm from start to finish. This report will focus on the Q&amp;A session with the director. We hope that you will contemplate on the messages that are conveyed. Director Tomino introduces the core of <em>&#8220;Turn A</em>&#8221; during the Q&amp;A session. </p>



<p>First, he was asked what he thought of Syd Mead&#8217;s designs, which has been the subject of much controversy. </p>



<p><strong>Tomino:</strong> I don&#8217;t want people to misunderstand—Mr. Syd Mead is just one mechanical designer. <em>Gundam</em>&#8216;s basic design philosophy is still that of Mr. Kunio Okawara&#8217;s, so any future installments will likely feature Mr. Okawara. There may be some tentative plans already in the works. Also, Mr. Syd Mead&#8217;s designs are symbolic of an industrialized society, which we have an instinctive reluctance to accept.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Given that Mr. Syd Mead was the main designer of <em>Blade Runner</em>, this feeling is easy to understand. The film is set in a near-future slum where acid rain falls. It depicts one end of the road for a technologically-advanced society, which leaves the viewer feeling melancholic. Mr. Mead has worked on many industrial design projects, which, based on their sensibility and craftsmanship, are quite different from the world of Japanese animation. What was Director Tomino&#8217;s intent in combining these two worlds into a single work?</p>



<p><strong>Tomino:</strong> I asked Mr. Syd Mead because I thought Mr. Akira Yasuda&#8217;s characters would be able to balance his designs. </p>



<p>However, later on he said &#8220;I am now very convinced&#8221;, which confused the interviewers. </p>



<p class="has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-a65245ceac3077bc7fa8deee201f59f4"><strong><em>The Illusion of the Good Old Days Shows its Dark Side</em></strong></p>



<p>Next was another design-related question.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What about the characters?</p>



<p><strong>Tomino:</strong> I met Mr. Yasuda by chance two years ago. When we met, he drew a picture on colored paper right in front of me. In that moment, my decision was made.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Akira Yasuda&#8217;s designs clearly made a strong impression on the director. But why did he dress the characters in outfits many would consider old-fashioned? They&#8217;re reminiscent of the early 20th century.</p>



<p><strong>Tomino:</strong> People were probably more full of life in the era after the Industrial Revolution, when we were finally entering the 20th century.</p>



<p>The director says this at first but then points out that a certain danger lurks in the way we feel nostalgia for that time.</p>



<p><strong>Tomino: </strong>On the other hand, one must assume that there was a class of people that was being oppressed. However, these people still went on with their lives. We are prepared to take all that into account to set the stage for <em>Turn A Gundam</em>.</p>

<p>This is what the director says about the world. For example, while the pioneering era of the American Frontier is looked back on fondly, it was only made possible by oppressing people of color and the poor. And when we find ourselves nostalgic for the good old days, we often only remember the ordinary but privileged citizens who probably weren&#8217;t aware that they were oppressing others. <em>Turn A Gundam</em> is a production that doesn&#8217;t shy away from addressing such unintentional malice.</p>



<p class="has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6554369536f67f4a6436832e166106ad"><strong><em>Turn A Gundam</em></strong> <strong><em>aims for a world beyond the end of the century</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> So what kind of world is the director trying to paint in <em>Turn A Gundam</em>? I am curious about Newtypes and space colony gadgets.</p>



<p><strong>Tomino:</strong> While I do think these concepts are necessary as part of a storyline, I don&#8217;t want them to serve as a hook for otaku, so they will not be included. The world will be a place where the people live in accordance with the cycle of the seasons. I hate the idea of the &#8220;End of the Century&#8221;. I think it is a phrase that consciously drives oneself to a dead end. Humans are animals that can accept the comings of cycles. I&#8217;d like to tell such a story to today&#8217;s children, and more specifically to adults. I hope that adults will be able to find words in this story that can heal their exhaustion.</p>



<p>This is similar to the interpretation of <em>Turn A Gundam</em> by Asei Kobayashi, composer of the opening theme song (lyrics by Director Tomino), who shared a video message on the same day of the event. Recognizing the 20th century as one of both progress and massacres, Kobayashi calls the 21st century a time where questions arise after realizing that progress may be limited. Director Tomino is trying to create a work with this in mind.</p>



<p>In the words of Director Tomino, progress is the key in modern times: economic growth, scientific development, and the improvement of daily life. In the 20th century, people went to the Moon less than half a century after the Wright brothers&#8217; first flight, and people vie for electrical appliances that guarantee affluence.</p>



<p>However, as environment issues have revealed, what was once thought to be correct needs to be re-examined. Questions are being raised about what the era beyond the end of the century should look like.</p>



<p>The story of &#8220;<em>Gundam</em>&#8220;, which once fascinated us as a drama about people searching for &#8220;what a person should be&#8221;, is now searching for &#8220;what an era should be&#8221;.</p>



<p>At the end of the press conference, the director says &#8220;You won&#8217;t get anywhere with a world view that travels in a straight line, like a blind march of economic growth.&#8221; Perhaps we are now witnessing the beginning of a story that goes beyond the end of the century and is filled with greater abundance. Each and every one of us will be a witness to these precious events.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like the mindset that exemplifies the end of the century, so I&#8217;m making <em>Turn A</em>. I&#8217;m making <em>Turn A</em> because I knew that a project that is simply an extension of something else is not a work of art. I&#8217;m making <em>Turn A</em> because I realized that creation is always a challenge, and because life and death are a part of the times, the people, and perhaps all things.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m embarrassed to admit that I was late to realize this, but after 15 years of inaction I thought it wouldn&#8217;t be so bad to face that shame if it meant I can make my return with <em>Turn A Gundam</em>. That was my decision. If I wanted someone to keep it alive within the larger framework of software beyond just animation, film, or literature, I thought it would be nice to have a director with this attitude. With that, I present to you <em>Turn A Gundam</em>.</p>
