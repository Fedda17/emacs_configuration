<p>When Apple finally <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/contrary-to-rumors-the-iphone-15-has-a-standard-by-the-book-usb-c-port/2/">made the move to USB-C</a>, it did so in a very Apple way. That includes the offering of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2mhhmpwy">a $130 Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C) Pro cable</a>, one that's actually $160 if you need the full 3 meters. Could one cable, an object whose job is to transfer power and data and be completely unnoticed, be worth that kind of cash?</p>
<p>Lumafield, maker of manufacturing-minded industrial CT scanners, <a href="https://www.lumafield.com/article/usb-c-cable-charger-head-to-head-comparison-apple-thunderbolt-amazon-basics">studied this question across three dimensions</a>. After scanning Apple's top-of-the-line cable, a <a href="https://amzn.to/3FovOZA">$10 Amazon Basics model</a>, and USB-C cables costing $5.59 and $3.89, Lumafield had no definitive answer other than "we buy cables that meet our needs" and that "thereâ€™s plenty of room for clever engineering and efficient manufacturing" inside a seemingly defined spec like USB-C.</p>
<p>But we can say that if your goal is to buy one cable that will hold up to abuse, work with the power and data speeds of today and a reasonably distant tomorrow, and remove cables from your list of things that might be the problem? Lumafield's images show why Apple's alpha-cable might just be worth it.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976995#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976995&comments=1">Comments</a></p>
