<p>Different insects flap their wings in different manners. Understanding the variations between these modes of flight may help scientists design better and more efficient <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/09/these-solar-powered-origami-inspired-robots-can-change-shape-mid-flight/">flying robots</a> in the future. However, decoding insect flight is not as easy as it sounds.</p>
<p>Winged insects have been around for nearly <a href="https://research.gatech.edu/feature/ultrafast-flight">400 million years</a>, and the evolution of flight in different insect species influences things like how insects flap their wings, what makes some insects highly maneuverable, and how their flight muscles work. A new study has used a mix of evolutionary analysis and robotic model wings to better understand how different flight modes operate.</p>
<h2>Insects are the most skilled flyers</h2>
<p>There are organisms other than insects <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/06/why-do-bats-have-such-bizarrely-long-lifespans/">that can fly</a>. Scientists can also take inspiration from them, so what makes insect flight so special?</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976177#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976177&comments=1">Comments</a></p>
