<ul>
<li>CSM Genesis Driver</li>
<li>CSM Genesis Driver Buckle Edition</li>
<li>CSM Energy Lock Seed Set</li>
</ul>
<p>More details will be released on October 6th (October 5th in the US).  The previous <strong>CSM Kamen Rider Gaim</strong> items were released in the United States but we don&#8217;t have any information from <strong>Team Kamen Rider</strong> on whether or not this item will also see release in the United States.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more info!</p>
