<p>Metals are everywhere in the Universe, from hot gas giants where it rains molten iron to heavy elements formed as a star goes supernova. Exoplanet GJ 367b one-ups them all. This planet is <i>made </i>of metal.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/12/researchers-spot-a-mercury-like-planet-orbiting-a-star-30-light-years-away/">GJ 367b</a> is an extreme planet. This “super Mercury,” which orbits its star once every 7.7 hours, was first discovered by NASA’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/earth-sized-exoplanet-has-everything-it-needs-for-lots-of-volcanoes/">TESS</a> planet hunter in 2015. Now, scientists from the University of Turin in Italy and the Thüringer Landessternwarte in Germany have examined more recent measurements of the planet using ESO’s <a href="https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/lasilla/instruments/harps.html">HARPS spectrograph</a> along with the original TESS observations. They found that this object is almost twice as dense as Earth—which suggests it is most likely made of solid iron.</p>
<p>Even though GJ 367b is now a solid iron planet, it might have once been the core of an ancient rocky planet.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976025#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976025&comments=1">Comments</a></p>
