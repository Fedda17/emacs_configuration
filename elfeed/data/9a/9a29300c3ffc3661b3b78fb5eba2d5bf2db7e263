<p>On Tuesday, officials at Oregon State University <a href="https://x.com/OregonState/status/1716897541080650171?s=20">issued a warning</a> on social media about a bomb threat concerning <a href="https://www.starship.xyz/">Starship Technologies</a> food delivery robots, autonomous wheeled drones that deliver food orders stored within a built-in container. By 7 pm local time, a suspect had <a href="https://apnews.com/article/oregon-state-university-bomb-threat-food-delivery-robots-8a71632f69115c76552e533220e2a7ba">been arrested</a> in the prank, and officials declared there had been no bombs hidden within the robots.</p>

<p>"Bomb Threat in Starship food delivery robots," reads the 12:20 pm initial X post from OSU. "Do not open robots. Avoid all robots until further notice." In <a href="https://x.com/OregonState/status/1716907179578691853?s=20">follow-up posts</a>, OSU officials said they were "r<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">emotely isolating robots in a safe location" for investigation by a technician. By 3:54 pm local time, experts had cleared the robots and promised they would be "back in service" by 4 pm.<br>

<p>In response, Starship Technologies provided this statement <a href="https://venturebeat.com/automation/bomb-hoax-leads-starship-to-temporarily-suspend-food-delivery-robots/">to the press</a>: "A student at Oregon State University sent a bomb threat, via social media, that involved Starshipâ€™s robots on the campus. While the student has subsequently stated this is a joke and a prank, Starship suspended the service. Safety is of the utmost importance to Starship and we are cooperating with law enforcement and the university during this investigation."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978421#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978421&comments=1">Comments</a></p>
