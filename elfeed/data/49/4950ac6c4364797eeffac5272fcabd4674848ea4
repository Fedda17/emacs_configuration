<p>It's hard to appreciate poetry in a language one doesn't know, so this is my attempt to make Italian poetry more easily enjoyable to English speakers. The approach is probably a bit nerdy, so I hope that at least it will be of interest on HN.<p>I basically implemented what I would like to have when I listen to songs or poems in a language I don't speak: karaoke-like, word by word, literal translation, with notes about word usage and some context when needed.<p>And some stuff about the language itself --- the part needed for the poems, at least.<p>The tech stack is as minimal as it gets: I was hoping for an old web vibe.<p>Feedback welcome!</p>
