<p>When we got our first glimpse of the PlayStation 5 over three years ago now, we made immediate note of how the hardware's black-and-white curves concealed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/the-playstation-5-looks-to-be-the-biggest-game-console-ever-made/">the largest home game console in decades</a>. Today, Sony is ready to do something about all that bulk, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/10/10/new-look-for-ps5-console-this-holiday-season/">announcing new models</a> of both the PS5 and the PS5 Digital Edition in a "new slimmer size."</p>
<p>The new units—which will be rolling out via "select local retailers" and <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/">PlayStation Direct</a> this month—sport the same internal hardware power as the circa 2020 PS5. But these new models come with a 30-plus percent reduction in volume and an 18 to 24 percent reduction in weight compared to current PS5 models, according to Sony. They also feature a 1TB SSD that the PlayStation Blog describes as "more internal storage" than the original units, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/our-playstation-5-has-arrived-heres-what-we-can-show-you-thus-far/">officially listed 825GB of storage space</a>.</p>

<p>Besides the thinner profile, the slimmer units also feature a striking curved slit bisecting each faceplate into "glossy" and "matte" sections (new colored faceplates for these models will be available for $54.99 starting in early 2024, Sony says). Unfortunately, the redesign means the new models won't be able to stand vertically out of the box—a $29.99 Vertical Stand will be required for that orientation now. But the front-facing USB-A port on the current PS5 has also been replaced with a second USB-C port on the new models, fully cementing the move to the new standard.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1974850#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1974850&comments=1">Comments</a></p>
