Machine-learning technique reveals Greek words in CT scans of rolled-up papyrus.</p> <p>The text is one of some 800 scrolls unearthed in the ancient Roman city of Herculaneum in the 1700s. Archaeologists discovered the trove in a villa that may have belonged to Julius Caesar’s father-in-law, a senior Roman statesman.</p> <p>These discoveries are critical steps toward deciphering the remaining unopened scrolls in the villa. “Recovering such a library would transform our knowledge of the ancient world in ways we can hardly imagine,” says Robert Fowler, a classicist at the University of Bristol in England, to the Times. “The impact could be as great as the rediscovery of manuscripts during the Renaissance.”</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HaroldGodwin"> /u/HaroldGodwin </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03212-1">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/17b1eqk/ai_reads_ancient_scroll_charred_by_mount_vesuvius/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>
