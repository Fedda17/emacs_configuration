<p><strong><em>Simoun ~Denpa DE Ri-Maajon~</em></strong> was an online radio program about the anime <em>Simoun</em>. It was hosted by Rieko Takahashi (Neviril&#8217;s VA) and Mikako Takahashi (Rodoreamon&#8217;s VA). As you might know, Rieko Takahashi is the voice actress of Dianna Soreil &amp; Kihel Heim. Her role as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://simoun.fandom.com/wiki/Neviril" target="_blank">Neviril</a> is notable because it&#8217;s her only other anime role as a main character. She isn&#8217;t particularly active in the anime industry, opting instead to focus on her theater career. Takahashi continues to be an active performer at the theater troupe <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%BC%94%E5%8A%87%E9%9B%86%E5%9B%A3_%E5%86%86" target="_blank">Yen</a>, which she was originally recruited from to audition for role(s) in <em>Turn A Gundam</em>. She was colleagues with Romi Park and had a fast friendship with her; Park would reprise her membership at Yen for years after <em>Turn A Gundam</em> finished airing, finally retiring in 2017. In the radio program, Rieko Takahshi often advertises her upcoming performances to listeners.</p>



<p>Anyhow, in radio episode #23, <em>Turn A Gundam</em> is briefly discussed as part of a recurring segment in which listeners write in and create their own &#8220;Ri-Maajons&#8221;. In <em>Simoun</em>&#8216;s world, these are trajectory rituals that the Simoun aircraft perform with varying destructive effects. In other words, it&#8217;s how they do aerial battle. I&#8217;ve translated and created a subtitle video of the segment for your viewing pleasure. To better understand the clip, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that there&#8217;s a running gag that Rieko Takahashi is rather forgetful about things of all nature, including works she was previously involved in. It&#8217;s a fun little conversation!</p>

<p>For anyone reading who&#8217;s uninitiated, <em>Simoun</em> is a mid-2000s shoujo military drama. It has an interesting premise where everyone in its world is presumably born female, and the characters live in a theocracy that holds access to a magical spring that allows one to change/choose their physical sex when they reach adulthood. War is brewing with surrounding nations and the main characters pilot fighter aircraft called &#8220;Simoun&#8221; to defend their country. The show has a lot to unpack in its abstract philosophy and gender commentary, and it also features stunning background art by Shichirou Kobayashi. If you&#8217;d like to learn more, the <em>Simoun</em> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://simoun.fandom.com/wiki/Simoun_Wiki" target="_blank">fandom</a> page is a good place to start, and my friend Thaliarchus has a nice <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://327robots.wordpress.com/2020/12/07/simoun/" target="_blank">overview on their blog</a> as well.</p>

<p>Some other takeaways about Rieko Takahashi from the radio program:</p>



<ul>
<li>&#8220;Riecchi&#8221; is her nickname and people tend to think she&#8217;s very mature.</li>



<li>She likes to go to the beach to watch people, not to actually do anything fun herself.</li>



<li>She walks around with a parasol/umbrella in the summer heat.</li>



<li>She didn&#8217;t watch every episode of <em>Simoun</em> as it aired but did her best to catch up.</li>



<li>She&#8217;s very bad at computers and in general isn&#8217;t good at using technology.</li>



<li>She would choose to be a woman if she had to pick her sex at the <em>Simoun</em> fountain. In her words, &#8220;women are more interesting and mysterious&#8221;, citing the fact that they can give birth.</li>



<li>She jogs at midnight to stay healthy.</li>



<li>One of her friends often criticizes her because she only has one voice acting style.</li>



<li>She only vaguely knows about <em>Dragon Ball</em> and <em>Sailor Moon</em>.</li>



<li>She doesn&#8217;t know much about Char Aznable, aside from him being the most popular <em>Gundam</em> character.</li>



<li>She wants to buy land on the Moon.</li>



<li>One fan wrote in and jokingly called her the &#8220;Creator of the Dark History&#8221;. Many fans wrote in after radio episode #23, happy that they had finally discussed <em>Turn A Gundam</em> on the show.</li>



<li>They held two popularity ranking polls during the course of the radio program, and in the first one Neviril came in 3rd, and in the second she came in 9th.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you&#8217;d like to listen to the radio program yourself, I&#8217;ve compiled a list of Niconico uploads <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pastebin.com/HkAb7S0s" target="_blank">here</a>. There are a lot of interesting tidbits to unpack in each episode, but this blog post isn&#8217;t the place for that. Highly recommended if you&#8217;re a <em>Simoun</em> fan though.</p>



<p>But wait&#8230; here&#8217;s a bonus clip! I haven&#8217;t subtitled it because it&#8217;s a pain in the butt to properly translate let alone edit. This is from a recurring segment in which Rieko Takahashi is challenged to perform a tongue-twister, usually using words from a relevant topic. This one&#8217;s from the same episode (#23) and appropriately uses the Moon, i.e. æœˆ (&#8220;tsuki&#8221;) and other similar-sounding words like &#8220;kiss&#8221;.</p>
