<p>A relentless team of pro-Russia hackers has been exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in widely used webmail software in attacks targeting governmental entities and a think tank, all in Europe, researchers from security firm ESET said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The previously unknown vulnerability resulted from a critical cross-site scripting error in Roundcube, a server application used by <a href="https://roundcube.net/about/">more than 1,000 webmail services</a> and millions of their end users. Members of a pro-Russia and Belarus hacking group tracked as Winter Vivern used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">XSS bug</a> to inject JavaScript into the Roundcube server application. The injection was triggered simply by viewing a malicious email, which caused the server to send emails from selected targets to a server controlled by the threat actor.</p>
<h2>No manual interaction required</h2>
<p>“In summary, by sending a specially crafted email message, attackers are able to load arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the Roundcube user’s browser window,” ESET researcher Matthieu Faou <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/winter-vivern-exploits-zero-day-vulnerability-roundcube-webmail-servers/">wrote</a>. “No manual interaction other than viewing the message in a web browser is required.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978806#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978806&comments=1">Comments</a></p>
