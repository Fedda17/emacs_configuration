Increasingly, when I read about this war, it feels less like a typical Israel-Palestine blowup and more like an extension of <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/why-the-us-should-fight-cold-war">Cold War 2</a>. </p><p>But what does that even mean? I think of a &#8220;cold war&#8221; as basically a<em> model</em> &#8212; a framework for understanding world events. Think about the original Cold War. We say that things like the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, or the U.S.-supported coup against Salvador Allende, or Soviet spying, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinating_Committee_for_Multilateral_Export_Controls">CoCOM</a>, or the movie Rocky IV were &#8220;part of the Cold War&#8221;, but there&#8217;s no hard-and-fast definition of what that means. Nobody declared the Cold War, or made policies that used that name. Instead, the competition between the U.S. and the USSR was just a <em>mental framework</em> that writers and politicians and regular people used to make sense of what they saw happening in the world around them &#8212; a way to view many small events as part of one overarching big event.</p><p>In the same way, I think of &#8220;Cold War 2&#8221; as a model for how to think about a lot of the geopolitical happenings in the world today &#8212; and some of the economic and cultural ones as well. The Israel-Gaza war, and the bizarre and toxic discourse on both <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/western-leftists-have-lost-the-plot">the far left</a> and the far right in America, the sudden return of industrial policy and the reshaping of supply chains, and so on &#8212; can be understood as being at least partly outgrowths of the great-power contest between the U.S. and its democratic allies and an authoritarian bloc led by China and Russia. (If you prefer not to think of these blocs in ideological terms, I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcVSgYz5SJ8">Sarah C.M. Paine&#8217;s framework</a> of &#8220;maritime&#8221; vs. &#8220;continental&#8221; powers works just as well.)</p><p>This is one reason I&#8217;ve been writing a fair amount about geopolitics over the last three years, and especially since Russia invaded Ukraine. So many of the economic changes we&#8217;re seeing now, and which are being planned for the next two decades, are either being driven by Cold War 2 concerns or will have an impact on the outcome of Cold War 2. In a world where the economy becomes a key tool that great powers use to prosecute their conflicts, it&#8217;s completely impossible to just &#8220;stick to the economics&#8221;. </p><p>Now, if the power of models is to simplify, the danger of models is that they can easily be over-applied (as <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/a-failed-economic-theory-of-everything">some macroeconomists have discovered</a>). It&#8217;s tempting to become so obsessed with Cold War 2 that you see a spy behind every tree, or a foreign propaganda message behind every bad take on Twitter. So I want to draw connections between seemingly disparate events while being careful not to accidentally prod people into conspiracy thinking. </p><p>Anyway, that having been said, let&#8217;s talk a bit about why the big topic that&#8217;s occupying the nation&#8217;s mind these days is really about Cold War 2 &#8212; as is a lot of the other dire stuff we&#8217;re seeing in the news.</p><h4>The Israel-Gaza war as a Cold War 2 proxy conflict</h4>
