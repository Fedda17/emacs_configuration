Fred Wilson, the co-founder of Union Square Ventures, said in 2016 that startups that took corporate money were &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFBkaOpVKIw">doing business with the devil</a>,&#8221; yet the only remaining difference between the current state of venture capital and private equity appears to be how willing they are to say the quiet part (&#8220;we need to make money off of this investment&#8221;) out loud.&nbsp;</p><p>Silicon Valley&#8217;s key differentiator was that it was theoretically the place where venture capital took risks on interesting and innovative technology, yet the best-funded startups remain siloed in whatever industry venture capital believes will be &#8220;big,&#8221; even if they haven&#8217;t got any true path to profitability.</p><p>It may also be a result of the different incentives that bring people to the Bay Area and the tech industry in general. A decade ago,<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/glassdoor-google-offers-best-salaries-for-software-engineers-in-2012/"> engineers made an average base salary of $92,648</a> versus<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/software-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0,17.htm#:~:text=The%20estimated%20total%20pay%20for,salaries%20collected%20from%20our%20users."> $139,729 in 2023.</a><a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/billionaires/"> The software industry has created 82 new billionaires since 2010</a>, and<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/lyft-uber-slack-airbnb-ipo-millionaires-123523288.html"> the 2019 tech IPO rush created an estimated 5000 new millionaires across eight tech companies</a>.<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/earths-unicorn-population-is-exploding/#:~:text=When%20the%20venture%20capitalist%20Aileen,into%20unicorns%20every%20single%20day."> In 2013, there were 39 unicorns</a> (tech companies worth a billion dollars or more).<a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies"> According to CBInsights, there are now over a thousand of them</a>. And because Andreessen and his fellow venture stooges forced so many lossy, unprofitable companies to go public, many of them are underwater (<a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/tech-startup-ipo-performance/">and they have been for some time</a>), with the top 50 Tech IPOs since 2020<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230514042124/https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/385046/the-frozen-tech-market-stagnates.html"> losing 59% of their market capitalization as of May 13 2023</a>.</p><p>As a result, the Valley is left with the avaricious culture of the finance industry without any of the stability. Venture capital&#8217;s elite turned startups into alternative investments, fattened them up to sell, and, when the market dropped out in 2022 and 2023,<a href="https://wheresyoured.at/p/techs-elite-hates-labor"> shrugged their shoulders and blamed the workers</a>.<a href="https://fortune.com/2023/02/11/marc-andreessen-remote-work-has-detonated-way-we-connect-young-professionals-will-suffer/"> They</a>,<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-changing-111842034.html"> along with tech&#8217;s leaders</a>,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/19/opinion/tech-layoffs-meta-amazon-silicon-valley.html"> derided a culture of &#8220;entitlement&#8221;</a> that they themselves created.

The tech industry &#8212; by which I mean the Valley&#8217;s powerful venture arm &#8212; spent a decade convincing software engineers that they were an elevated class, promising them the world and oftentimes delivering it without requiring them to build something that improved the world in any way. And the <em>second</em> the party ended &#8212; the moment that the economy stopped endlessly providing growth to every single company in the market, and when money stopped being free &#8212; tech was ready to eject tens of thousands of workers, and tech&#8217;s venture capitalists were ready to stop signing checks and start requiring &#8220;hard numbers&#8221; for the first time in years.</p><p>And the problem with an industry that is led and powered by venture capital is that it doesn&#8217;t build any real culture. &#8220;Startup culture&#8221; is a vague shibboleth that exists to justify labor abuse in exchange for a theoretical massive payday in the future, with the hollow premise that there is something more noble about writing code or &#8220;working at an early-stage company&#8221; than there is any other job. While there <em>are</em> people doing cool, weird or societally-beneficial shit, they are endlessly drowned out by a combination of founders trying to build &#8220;the next big thing,&#8221; with &#8220;big&#8221; referring to how much they can sell it for, and &#8220;thing&#8221; being &#8220;whatever is going to sell to someone.&#8221;</p><p>Sadly, the only way to reverse this trend is for venture capital&#8217;s incentives to entirely change, something that will not happen as long as we live in<a href="https://wheresyoured.at/p/the-rot-economy"> the era of growth-at-all-costs rot economics</a>. While investors are now suddenly concerned about &#8220;market fundamentals&#8221; and profitability, it&#8217;s tough to believe that this represents a long-term systemic change, but rather empty platitudes designed to soothe the institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals that typically fill VC coffers. I&#8217;ve found no evidence to suggest that this sudden cautiousness is anything more than a momentary blip that will fade as soon as interest rates descend from their post-pandemic spike. It is &#8212; and I really fucking hate this term &#8212; virtue signalling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Without real, long-term change, Silicon Valley will remain a decrepit West Coast version of Wall Street where innovation fights to be heard above the endless white noise of valuations and venture&#8217;s vultures.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://wheresyoured.at/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Ed Zitron's Where's Your Ed At!
