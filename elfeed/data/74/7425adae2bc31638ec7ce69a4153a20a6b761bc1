<p>Apple announced monthly price hikes for several online services on Wednesday, including its catchall Apple One subscription service.</p>
<p>Apple TV+ will jump from $6.99 to $9.99 per month, while Apple Arcade will go from $4.99 to $6.99 monthly. Apple News+ used to cost $9.99 per month, but now it's $12.99.</p>
<p>Those three services are bundled alongside iCloud and (in the Premier tier) Fitness+ in Apple One, the company's pseudo-Amazon Prime all-in-one offering. That service will also increase in price. Individual plans will go from $16.95 to $19.95 monthly, family plans will go from $22.95 to $25.95, and Premier plans will now cost $37.95 instead of $32.95.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978725#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978725&comments=1">Comments</a></p>
