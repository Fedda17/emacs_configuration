<p>T-Mobile is moving people to newer, more expensive plans starting with the November bill cycle unless customers call the company to opt out, according to multiple reports.</p>
<p>The forced migration <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/174s0rx/forced_plan_migrations_coming_soon/">surfaced on Reddit</a> two days ago and was <a href="https://tmo.report/2023/10/breaking-t-mobile-will-force-customers-onto-newer-plans-unless-you-opt-out/">confirmed by The Mobile Report</a>, which published portions of leaked documents indicating how the plan changes will be implemented. T-Mobile also confirmed the change to CNET, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/t-mobile-is-forcibly-moving-those-on-older-plans-to-some-of-its-newer-ones-in-november/">telling the news site</a> that "there will be an increase of approximately $10 per line with the migration."</p>
<p>"We're always looking for ways to give our customers more from our services so we're moving a small number who were on older rate plans to newer plans that will deliver them enhanced features," T-Mobile told CNET.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975700#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975700&comments=1">Comments</a></p>
